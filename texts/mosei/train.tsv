102184	85.248	90.029	-1.6666666269302368	11	 And (umm) it's just a big puddle of, you know, mess
102184	76.627	85.529	-2.6666667461395264	10	 The acting surprisingly enough was actually worse than the first two which is really saying something, you know, it's probably the definitely the weakest point of the first two movies
102184	96.971	100.834	-0.6666666865348816	13	 Well, it ruined the trilogy, I don't know if it ruined the first two movies for me
102184	89.029	97.702	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Even the action sequences aren't as good as (uhh) the first and the second one so I gotta say it purp (stutter), I will, don't know if I say it ruined the trilogy
102184	13.69	17.903	0.6666666865348816	1	 And you know I was pretty, I was looking forward to this movie you know quite a bit
102184	0.371	13.962	0.0	0	I'll be reviewing (uhh) the movie Spider-Man Three which is currently in the theaters, which is the third and looked like the final, you know, these the Spider-Man trilogy but there might be more made with different actors or even a different director, it's hard to say
102184	34.194	42.786	1.0	3	 I mean they always had good villains with like Alfred Molina playing (umm) Doctor Octopus and, you know, (umm) that kind of thing
102184	17.202	34.395	0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) You know I was a big fan of the first so that they were done pretty well, you know, with Sam Raimi directing it's pretty much, you know, the perfect choice, you know, for the, for the (stutter) movies in that, you know, he didn't take them too seriously, you know he knew how to joke around with the makeup, kind of, you know, goofy and kind of like booky and that kind of thing and it really worked for the (uhh) first two
102184	45.707	58.122	-2.0	5	 (uhh) They had too many villains and it was just really hokey and it felt like they were just trying to do way, I mean, really it felt like it was two movies they tried to cram into one and (uhh) they didn't give enough time to relay anything
102184	42.255	45.79	-2.6666667461395264	4	 (umm) But for some reason the third one really fell apart
102184	66.62	69.705	-1.6666666269302368	7	 I just really left the theater feeling just kind of (uhh)
102184	58.049	67.62	-1.0	6	 (uhh) I mean Peter Parker's character, you know, was (uhh) even, you know, when controlled by the symbiote (umm) it's just (uhh) it's just kind of a big mess
102184	72.756	77.627	-2.6666667461395264	9	 It's just, it's a bad movie (uhh), you know? With bad characterizations
102184	69.733	73.756	-2.6666667461395264	8	 And the more and more I thought about it, the more and more I just really hated the movie
10223	3.364	7.606	-1.0	1	 This is the fourth DVD in the series i'm xxx but completely unnecessary
10223	0.0	3.625	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I am doing my video premium for Wolf's Rain - Recollections
10223	17.222	35.413	-1.0	3	 The (uhh) video, the animation in the episode most of like most like (stutter) almost all if not all is rehashed in this animation is just (uhh) taken out from the previous episodes so they didn't even make the original animations because they are retelling the story that's already happened so they are just reusing all that animation
10223	6.606	16.596	0.0	2	 It contains four episodes and each episode is it focuses on one of the four main characters retelling what's happen so far in the story from their perspectives
10223	38.234	41.829	0.0	5	 It's just (uhh) pretty obvious stuff you know
10223	35.092	39.234	-0.3333333432674408	4	 The audio is new but it doesn't tell you very much
10223	43.592	62.571	-1.0	7	 It seems like they made this DVD just to fill a gap (uhh) during the time where they couldn't make new episodes I guess I don't know but it's (uhh) pretty upsetting but this DVD costs the same price as all the other DVDs in this series when it has nothing new
10223	40.908	43.994	-1.0	6	 They're basically saying this happened and this happened
10223	72.616	76.37	0.6666666865348816	9	 It's (uhh) you know just get three then go on to five
10223	62.918	73.616	-1.3333333730697632	8	 So, if you're a die hard fan and you wanna xxx and if you just want to watch everything in Wolf's Rain Wolf's Rain (stutter) (uhh) then you can get it but I wouldn't recommend it
106077	59.287	64.288	1.6666666269302368	11	 Now as for the shooting and the acting, it was fantastic
106077	54.049	60.287	-1.6666666269302368	10	 I I (stutter) cannot explain this movie in any way shape or form because I simply did not understand it
106077	72.257	78.376	-1.6666666269302368	13	 So, as I said, Vanilla Sky is receiving two stars from me and that's pushing it
106077	63.766	72.619	-0.6666666865348816	12	 The movie was acted very well and I was very comfortable in that regard but, the simple story line was too difficult for me to follow
106077	77.984	80.79	-1.3333333730697632	14	 It's probably more like one and a half
106077	7.834	12.266	0.3333333432674408	1	 Tom Cruise is in this movie with Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz
106077	0.301	7.527	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, Summer Banks here and today I'm reviewing for you, the DVD Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise
106077	18.35	22.932	-1.6666666269302368	3	 Now I have to let you know I'm giving this movie two stars
106077	11.884	18.721	0.0	2	 The movies is rated R for sexuality and strong language and is brought to you by Paramount pictures
106077	31.959	34.545	0.3333333432674408	5	 This is a thriller
106077	22.4	32.101	-2.0	4	 The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I've watched it approximately five times and I still have absolutely zero idea what really happened
106077	41.447	45.43	-1.0	7	 There are finales that aren't really finales
106077	34.413	41.819	0.0	6	 There are events that take place that you don't know if they're real, if they're not real
106077	49.499	54.6	0.0	9	 There's some that are there that you don't see til later on
106077	44.57	50.499	-1.0	8	 There are beginnings and events that aren't really there
106514	60.883	64.218	-0.3333333432674408	11	 But, I mean, then again those were very campy films
106514	53.26	61.803	-1.0	10	 Like he used to be at least an interesting director what what (stutter) with like you know, the Evil Dead trilogy
106514	71.07	85.998	-2.6666667461395264	13	 But anyway (umm) plot was hopelessly absurd (umm) and uninteresting to boot and yeah
106514	63.417	71.601	-0.6666666865348816	12	 This is summer blockbuster so I don't know, maybe his artistic talent maybe just doesn't translate
106514	88.69	93.292	-1.0	15	 He showed up and then bam, he was gone
106514	84.998	89.361	-1.3333333730697632	14	 I I (stutter) don't even know why they introduced Venom
106514	95.624	107.439	1.0	17	 Anyways, for the positives about this film (umm) Stan Lee does another cameo, which was a little bit funny
106514	93.18	95.936	0.0	16	 Hopefully I didn't spoil it for anybody
106514	4.86	7.078	-1.6666666269302368	1	 (umm) What a way to end the trilogy
106514	0.0	4.523	0.3333333432674408	0	This is a review of the movie Spider-Man three
106514	10.867	14.89	-2.3333332538604736	3	 The second one was silly and this one was worse
106514	6.078	11.777	1.3333333730697632	2	 Let's see the first Spider-Man film was pretty good, half of it was at least
106514	30.861	35.423	-0.6666666865348816	5	 Tobey Maguire (stutter) clearly didn't want to be doing this role anymore
106514	15.616	30.844	-2.0	4	 Not only was it excessively long and had way too many characters in it, (stutter) Spider-Man three just lacked substance on all levels I would say
106514	38.663	42.836	-0.6666666865348816	7	 She couldn't at the very least she wasn't acting in this film
106514	34.523	38.875	-2.3333332538604736	6	 Kirsten Dunst I don't know if she could ever act
106514	50.736	54.26	-0.3333333432674408	9	 I guess something happened
106514	45.698	51.736	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (uhh) The direction, it was Sam Raimi, I I (stutter) just don't understand
106941	64.904	67.69	0.3333333432674408	11	 It's an accurate description
106941	55.096	65.904	-2.0	10	 It was worse, but at the same time it was very forced, almost pornographic is a term that's thrown around a lot that I agree with
106941	67.328	77.907	-1.6666666269302368	12	 And (uhh) I didn't care about any of the characters in this film unlike the protagonist from the first one so
106941	5.928	8.933	-1.0	1	 (uhh) Well, what to say about this film
106941	0.47	4.743	0.0	0	This is a review of the movie Hostel Part two
106941	12.643	24.817	-0.3333333432674408	3	 Hostel was, it wasn't scary, but it was gruesome and kind of had some dark humor to it and a fairly interesting plot
106941	8.722	12.156	-0.6666666865348816	2	 Surely, surely (stutter) wasn't hostile
106941	31.34	37.838	0.0	5	 (uhh) going to the infamous hostel which leads to their demise, ultimately to their demise
106941	25.074	31.023	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) Hostel two pretty much rehashed the plot of one except it made it about women
106941	42.126	45.51	-1.6666666269302368	7	 It It's (stutter) been done already
106941	36.917	43.126	-1.0	6	 But (umm) Yeah, I was I just felt it was very rehashed
106941	50.487	56.096	-0.6666666865348816	9	 Not exponentially no, probably geometrically though
106941	44.51	51.487	-1.6666666269302368	8	 The violence in this film was exponentially worse I would say
107551	107.467	116.968	-1.0	11	 (umm) Like the great xxx said, if you have more than one ending for a story, you're in trouble and I think that holds true with this
107551	87.732	107.07	-1.3333333730697632	10	 And it had an alternate ending and when I watched it, I kinda realized now the, the (stutter) actual, alternate ending kinda, could have made the movie go into two different directions and because they had two endings in mind, I think that they didn't really get a grasp on the actually theme of the story, what it should be from start to finish
107551	120.059	129.739	-2.0	13	 They try to have little scary moments that you have seen in every other horror movie, you know, knock offs of of (stutter) the kind of scare tactics that other movies have used and they don't even do a good job with that
107551	116.876	120.62	-1.0	12	 I wouldn't recommend it, there's really not anything scary in it
107551	129.188	131.565	-1.6666666269302368	14	 So I didn't find this movie scary
107551	12.104	21.036	0.3333333432674408	1	 I got this movie because (uhh) I like horror movies every now and then and it says from the writer and director of Saw
107551	0.38	5.052	0.0	0	This review is for the movie Dead Silence
107551	29.115	31.961	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh) but I was very disappointed by this movie
107551	22.341	28.948	0.3333333432674408	2	 I really liked Saw, I thought Saw was a pretty interesting original movie so I thought this would be good too
107551	43.772	58.61	-2.3333332538604736	5	 I mean I understand in movies that you have to suspend, you know disbelief for the sake of the story but when it, when it (stutter) there is nothing on it to hold on to, then it kind of truth or reality then it kind of just becomes nothing you know, waste of time
107551	32.108	43.934	-1.3333333730697632	4	 There, it's just it's (stutter) there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense and a lot of stuff that just seems to be there just for the the (stutter) sake of the story like wouldn't happen otherwise
107551	61.202	77.248	-0.6666666865348816	7	 And (uhh) as I was watching the extended features, they were talking about how great the sets were, how you know how, how (stutter) all the stuff they did was incredible and and I think they put more emphasis on the look of the movie rather than the actual movie itself and story line and everything else
107551	58.229	60.756	0.0	6	 That's kind of what this movie became
107551	85.567	88.313	-1.3333333730697632	9	 It really seem like it was going all over
107551	77.954	86.567	-1.3333333730697632	8	 And another thing that I I (stutter) kind of realize why the movie wasn't that great cause it kind of didn't, really not make any sense to me
108793	51.005	60.177	-1.0	11	 Maybe it was because I had too much high hopes and (umm) I think Jim was okay in it, Robin Williams wasn't his normal funny self to me
108793	45.987	51.676	-1.6666666269302368	10	 And (umm) I didn't enjoy the movie, I I (stutter) really didn't, and I really wanted to
108793	62.449	68.807	1.0	13	 The funniest person in the whole movie is (umm) the little kid in the movie
108793	59.277	63.449	-0.6666666865348816	12	 I don't know, maybe I'm getting tired of him, but I mean, he wasn't all that funny
108793	78.174	94.06	0.3333333432674408	15	 He was hilarious in the movie and (umm) the the (stutter) rest of the movie, you know, (hmm) it could me just going into the movie thinking it's going to be too good but, I mean there were a couple funny parts but it just seemed like (uhh) like (stutter) they were trying to be funny
108793	68.067	78.795	1.3333333730697632	14	 And (umm) I have no idea what his name is, but (umm) he's in some new movie coming out, I've seen him in it, he was on Jay Leno the other night
108793	94.956	99.877	-1.3333333730697632	17	 And (umm) I'll say on a scale of one to ten it's maybe a four
108793	93.06	95.956	0.3333333432674408	16	 Funnier, more than being funny
108793	99.286	101.164	-0.6666666865348816	18	 Maybe a four
108793	2.845	6.489	1.3333333730697632	1	 I was, I was (stutter) really excited to see this movie
108793	1.308	3.845	0.0	0	License to Wed
108793	11.056	14.68	2.3333332538604736	3	 And (umm) it's also got Robin Williams in it who's hilarious
108793	6.177	11.587	2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm) I'm a huge fan of The Office and Jim was in it so I I (stutter) was definitely on board to see the movie
108793	18.809	21.834	0.0	5	 (umm) Let let's (stutter) go over the gist of the movie
108793	13.96	19.689	1.0	4	 Mandy Moore, she's really good in in (stutter) the few movies I've seen her in, but back to this movie
108793	27.229	40.073	0.0	7	 {clears throat} Are are (stutter) getting married but in order to get married at a certain church they have to pass the (umm) reverend's (stutter) marriage test that's to prove they're compatible
108793	21.333	28.229	0.3333333432674408	6	 Gist of the movie is Mandy Moore and Jim, I don't know his real name, (umm) I'll just call him Jim for
108793	40.888	46.817	0.0	9	 And and (stutter) (umm) Robin Williams is the pastor and he he (stutter) puts them through tests
108793	39.222	41.839	0.6666666865348816	8	 And (umm) they have three weeks to do it in
110203	5.668	10.929	0.0	1	 This is that new movie starring (umm) Robin Williams
110203	0.071	6.668	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, my name is Mike and today I am going to be talking to you about the movie License to Wed
110203	30.332	40.931	-1.0	3	 Okay {sigh} so when you look at this movie, Robin Williams can actually be a reasonably funny guy but for him to be really funny in a movie isn't enough
110203	11.056	29.676	0.0	2	 Basic premise of the movie, this couple gets engaged, wants to go and get married at horrible church but the new standards there require that the priest approve the wedding beforehand and the priest makes them go through all kinds of crazy stuff to get his approval
110203	48.631	54.729	-2.0	5	 The humor in the movie is just horrible, the plot is not that good or well rounded
110203	41.188	49.092	-1.0	4	 For it to be a good movie itself has to be funny, you can't just rely on the fact that he's a funny guy and that's what this movie does
110203	62.37	68.388	-1.3333333730697632	7	 So, License to Wed starring Robin Williams, one out of five
110203	53.729	62.422	-2.0	6	 It just kinda feels like someone slapped it together and in the end you know having a big name comedian doesn't save you in the end
110203	71.579	74.434	-0.6666666865348816	9	 This movie is an avoider
110203	67.737	71.99	-2.0	8	 You may be funny on your own but you weren't funny enough in this movie
110754	54.927	60.277	-2.0	11	 (umm) I feel that you would just waste your time if you watch this movie, so I would recommend not doing it
110754	49.249	54.5	-1.6666666269302368	10	 Very (umm) I don't know, stereotypical I I (stutter) feel
110754	6.666	11.897	0.0	1	 This is an MTV production DVD and it's starring Samuel Jackson
110754	0.38	7.177	0.0	0	This is Dustin with a video review for a DVD and today we're looking at Coach Carter
110754	16.155	24.927	0.0	3	 Basically he is a coach of a basketball team and there's all these kids that are like, troubled you know
110754	10.897	16.257	0.0	2	 As you can see there he's the little dude holding, well, kicking the basketball or whatever you wanna say
110754	29.614	33.488	0.0	5	 (uhh) Lots of drugs, gang things like that
110754	23.927	29.995	0.0	4	 They come from like, bad homes (uhh) bad families (uhh) bad friends
110754	34.623	41.968	0.6666666865348816	7	 (umm) Basically he teaches them that, you know, there's more to life than all these bad things and everything
110754	32.647	34.445	0.0	6	 You get the story
110754	47.274	50.17	-1.0	9	 (umm) I would have to give this movie a two out of five
110754	41.876	47.196	-2.3333332538604736	8	 (umm) Overall I didn't like this movie very much at all actually
110766	8.362	15.059	1.0	1	 (uhh) That's basically the best part of this movie is that it does feature Hilary Duff because she's pretty hot
110766	0.46	8.714	0.6666666865348816	0	This is Dustin with a video review of A Cinderella Story, starring Hilary Duff, as you can see on this dudes back here
110766	22.251	47.067	0.0	3	 (uhh) It's It's (stutter) like they try to make the story of Cinderella, the classic fairy tale, (uhh) into a modern day LA type story and basically, this girl, she she works like manual labor and all this and stuff and she has an email buddy and he ends up asking her to go to the dance with her
110766	14.977	22.323	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (uhh) But other than that, I mean this movie is (umm) {fart noise} not good at all
110766	50.576	56.256	0.3333333432674408	5	 So she starts freaking out and basically you know, they get together they go to the dance
110766	46.346	51.576	1.6666666269302368	4	 It ends up that this email buddy is like the coolest dude out there and stuff
110766	58.419	61.165	-2.0	7	 (umm) I would give this movie a two out of five
110766	55.256	58.231	1.0	6	 Aww it's all perfect and all that
110766	62.619	66.752	0.6666666865348816	9	 I mean if you're a chick, maybe a four out of five, maybe
110766	60.284	63.619	-1.0	8	 It's completely a chick flick
110788	5.589	25.855	0.0	1	 Its starring Reese Witherspoon and basically this movie is about this girl who falls in love with this guy and basically thinks she need to go to law school to get him and of course, she goes to Harvard and (umm) as you can see, she doesn't really fit in by the cover
110788	0.59	6.249	0.0	0	This is Dustin with a video review of the DVD called Legally Blonde
110788	32.687	42.717	0.0	3	 But basically it's about like you know, girl power and this stuff and like how blondes rule and all this and how everything goes her way because she's pretty
110788	24.855	33.208	-0.3333333432674408	2	 I mean she wears pink and dresses in stiletto shoes and everything and you know and that's not really the whole college scenes anyways
110788	49.299	52.474	0.0	5	 (umm) They say two thumbs up (umm) they're lying
110788	42.704	49.002	-3.0	4	 (uhh) This movie is, I would give it a one out of five, it is garbage
110788	51.993	55.707	0.0	6	 On the back they say a feel good girl power comedy
112148	59.586	64.118	-0.3333333432674408	11	 Spending all that money to go to the movies especially if you're going with someone else
112148	55.206	60.436	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (uhh) I definitely don't think it's worth a movie (uhh) ticket
112148	67.039	70.104	-1.0	13	 But (uhh) overall I wouldn't really recommend it
112148	63.587	67.66	1.0	12	 But (umm) if you have a chance to see it, check it out
112148	3.693	13.473	0.0	1	 Hostel: Part two is currently in theaters and it is directed by Eli Roth who also directed Hostel one and Cabin Fever
112148	0.82	3.925	0.0	0	Corbitt here reviewing Hostel: Part two
112148	17.023	30.345	0.0	3	 (umm) that is basically about a online type site where people pay to go to these foreign countries and basically kill tourists for money
112148	12.663	16.376	-1.0	2	 Hostel: Part two is a very gruesome movie
112148	32.318	34.914	-0.6666666865348816	5	 I wouldn't say it's the best movie
112148	30.283	32.999	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (umm) Basically it's very gruesome
112148	36.858	41.37	-1.6666666269302368	7	 But (uhh) I'd actually think that it's worse than the first one
112148	34.174	37.858	0.3333333432674408	6	 If you're a fan of the original Hostel, you might wanna check it out
112148	52.602	55.827	-0.3333333432674408	9	 But (uhh) overall I'm not really happy with it
112148	40.938	53.602	-1.6666666269302368	8	 Like I said, it's very gruesome and really that's the only thing the director tried to do is basically (uhh) make people squirm in their seats because of how gruesome it is and if you're looking for that kind of movie you might enjoy it
112169	87.582	111.051	0.0	11	 I thought the Umbridge actress was pretty good, she was a bitch which is what I wanted (umm) but, the movie, it tried putting random scares for no reason and the special effects were alright but with the budget this film had and how high my expectations were, this film is very horrible
112169	81.157	87.794	-1.0	10	 (umm) If you haven't read the books, it will probably be really confusing since the director tried to cram everything in there
112169	111.628	114.952	-2.0	13	 I would recommend instead you read the book
112169	110.051	112.099	-2.6666667461395264	12	 I would not recommend it
112169	2.925	6.569	0.0	1	 (umm) I am reviewing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
112169	1.278	2.707	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello
112169	19.806	39.873	-2.0	3	 He's back! (umm) Yeah and in this, I was very disappointed with this film (umm), I'm a pretty big Harry Potter fan and I enjoyed the fourth movie pretty, yeah I enjoyed the fourth movie, (umm) but this movie, I would have to give it ten fingers down
112169	5.609	20.038	-0.3333333432674408	2	 It is the fifth movie in the series and {noise} it is it's (stutter) probably one of the darker movies in the series, doesn't end on an happy note
112169	47.593	50.22	-2.3333332538604736	5	 Emma Watson cannot act
112169	40.25	47.605	-2.6666667461395264	4	 Yeah So, pretty much this movie fails on all levels
112169	59.925	63.39	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) He plays a lesser role
112169	51.035	58.471	0.6666666865348816	6	 Rupert Grint who is probably only one of the good actors in the series
112169	72.766	81.149	-0.3333333432674408	9	 You can tell it was shot from a flying vehicle over the water and not as someone following the flyers
112169	62.998	73.267	-1.3333333730697632	8	 The special effects aren't that great like the scene where they are flying on broom sticks towards (uhh) the order headquarters
112223	49.838	60.815	-2.0	11	 (uhh) I would definitely say if you do think you'd be interested in this, that you should rent it before you buy it, because personally I think it would be a waste of fifteen dollars
112223	46.067	49.78	0.3333333432674408	10	 But if that's your thing, then I guess you could try it out
112223	4.771	12.146	0.0	1	 (uhh) This is the third disc in the three disc Chobits collection and this one has chapter nine through twelve
112223	0.331	4.274	0.0	0	This is Chobits disc three, Darkness Descends
112223	15.037	20.627	0.0	3	 (uhh) Hideki, beside himself with joy, is going on a date with Yumi
112223	12.094	14.96	0.0	2	 (uhh) Each of them have four chapters on a disc
112223	23.648	29.447	-2.0	5	 If it's not your kind of thing, then I didn't really like it, but I don't like anime
112223	21.024	24.358	0.0	4	 (uhh) Basically this is an anime movie
112223	34.373	40.282	1.0	7	 So definitely, if you really like the first two, maybe you should check this out
112223	29.255	34.725	-2.6666667461395264	6	 (uhh) I've also heard from people who do enjoy it, this is by far the worst of the three
112223	42.096	46.348	-2.3333332538604736	9	 (uhh) I definitely didn't enjoy it, as somebody who's not into anime
112223	39.342	42.317	-1.3333333730697632	8	 But I've heard it's really not very good
112604	9.849	39.085	0.6666666865348816	1	 And it's about a modern day (uhh) Noah's Ark story and as as (stutter) and as you can imagine there's if you try to put the Noah's Ark story in modern times, there's gonna be some wacky hijinks that follow and obviously there are as (uhh) Steve Carrell becomes (uhh) Noah both in physical appearance and in his (uhh) duty to (uhh) build a huge ark in the middle of a populated American town, so
112604	0.0	10.27	0.3333333432674408	0	I'm doing a review for Evan Almighty which is a movie currently in theaters starring Steve Carrell, Morgan Freeman and Lauren Graham
112604	44.889	53.652	0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) I like Morgan Freeman a lot, I don't think these roles give him much to do but it's good seeing him and he he (stutter) plays a pretty convincing God
112604	39.761	44.483	0.0	2	 (umm) Morgan Freeman plays God, as he did in the Bruce Almighty movie
112604	54.068	56.435	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) Wasn't a big of this movie
112631	9.49	24.518	0.0	1	 It's about a young couple who are getting ready to wed but before they are allowed to do so in the church (uhh) the priest, played by Robin Williams, requires that they go through his (uhh) training classes for (uhh) to make sure they're ready for marriage
112631	0.51	9.891	0.0	0	This is a review for a movie currently in theaters called License to Wed, starring Robin Williams, John Krasinski and Mandy Moore
112631	32.597	36.58	-1.6666666269302368	3	 I'm not a big fan of Robin Williams at all
112631	24.416	33.278	0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) I primarily went to this movie because I'm a big fan of The Office and I like (uhh) John Krasinski's work on on (stutter) that show
112631	39.292	49.501	0.6666666865348816	5	 So I was hoping that (uhh) John Krasinski would balance out my dislike for Robin Williams and (uhh) Mandy Moore's an attractive lady so that was a plus
112631	35.58	40.232	-2.0	4	 I find him (uhh) pretty annoying to be honest
112631	53.31	56.625	1.0	7	 But the movie itself was alright
112631	48.501	53.801	-0.6666666865348816	6	 I'm no you know fan of her acting or anything so I was kind of indifferent towards her
112631	61.871	65.794	0.6666666865348816	9	 I didn't (uhh) Robin Williams was grating as usual
112631	55.625	62.402	-1.0	8	 It had a couple of funny scenes and a couple of funny lines but it wasn't it wasn't really worth going to
112903	11.056	17.354	-1.6666666269302368	1	 And (umm) basically the beginning of the end of original entertainment
112903	0.0	11.966	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, (umm) Sarah here talking about Spider-Man Three, one of the first of several extensions of trilogies or other series of the summer
112903	21.483	33.368	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It was satisfying in the laziest way, it was (umm) just basically the minimum that you might expect from an action movie
112903	16.574	22.483	1.6666666269302368	2	 And (umm) I think this movie was a perfect representation of that
112903	58.588	61.574	0.6666666865348816	5	 And it did break the box office records
112903	32.747	59.239	-2.3333332538604736	4	 The fight scenes were weak, the characters were completely underdeveloped, (umm) basically the story was all over the place and everything that was interesting about it was barely touched on at all and it just seemed like they put almost no effort into making it because they knew that because it was a trilogy and a successful series that they didn't have to actually try to get people to go to the theaters
112903	61.541	75.901	-2.6666667461395264	6	 And (umm) I think that's pretty pathetic, I mean maybe it's just trying, I mean it says that more and more people are going to the movies and less and less people actually care about what they're watching and taking in
113265	7.275	12.226	-2.6666667461395264	1	 I thought that movie was terrible actually
113265	0.65	8.045	-1.6666666269302368	0	I just saw Pirates of the Caribbean Three (uhh) At World's End and (uhh) I was a bit disappointed
113265	17.701	21.295	-2.0	3	 (uhh) First of all it was way too long, two and a half hours
113265	11.226	17.294	-2.3333332538604736	2	 It was probably the worst out of all three, and the second one wasn't that great either
113265	32.438	35.004	-2.6666667461395264	5	 I did not like it at all
113265	20.884	32.839	-2.0	4	 It was just boring and there's too much story to it, not enough action, like I would get up and leave just cause it was so bad and yeah
113265	47.184	54.729	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (uhh) The action scenes in that movie stunk, the story of that movie was pretty bad too
113265	34.812	45.53	-1.0	6	 Had some really good actors in it but (uhh) still Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and Kira Knightley don't really do it for me
113265	58.568	84.811	-2.3333332538604736	9	 Also like the second one, just kind of left you there like (uhh), what happens? So you definitely know they're going to make a fourth one but (uhh) I don't like that kind of thing and (uhh) I think Pirates of the Caribbean has gone on way too long and they should probably stop making it after this next movie or just stop in the middle of making the next movie and realize that their movies suck
113265	55.505	59.389	-2.0	8	 (umm) Also the ending of that movie sucked too
114624	46.775	48.434	-1.0	11	 (umm) Not impressed
114624	40.04	46.049	0.0	10	 (umm) If I remember, it was actually going to, I didn't watch the whole thing, but it was going to be fairly long
114624	52.482	56.376	-1.3333333730697632	13	 It's borderline okay, it's kind of bad, actually almost
114624	47.434	52.654	0.3333333432674408	12	 Would not going to give this one a very good rating (umm) It's okay
114624	6.247	8.015	-1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm) I wasn't too impressed
114624	0.0	5.79	0.0	0	This review is on the (umm) The English movie, I'll Be There
114624	9.679	13.882	0.0	3	 (umm) This is guy girl named guy named guy named (stutter) Craig Ferguson Charlotte Church
114624	7.015	9.801	-1.3333333730697632	2	 This is, I didn't even watch the whole thing to be honest with you
114624	18.699	28.828	0.3333333432674408	5	 It's about a girl who her dad was a rock star or is a rocks (stutter), was a rock star and she wants to sing as her career, his old assistant comes to help her
114624	13.341	19.3	0.0	4	 (stutter) I've seen Craig Ferguson before, (umm) but not not not (stutter), (uhh) Charlotte Church
114624	33.465	37.459	-0.6666666865348816	7	 Don't really know if it's a humorous movie or a serious movie, I can't really tell
114624	29.125	34.465	-1.6666666269302368	6	 It's an English movie (umm) Don't really get the humor in it
114624	38.264	40.512	0.0	9	 It's rated PG-thirteen
114624	37.157	39.264	0.0	8	 (umm) This is the widescreen version
11650	109.932	115.341	-1.3333333730697632	24	 But (umm) that sounds kind of funny, but the movie, stay away from Crank, the movie
11650	98.128	101.683	0.0	20	 The previews showed the biggest action part of the movie
11650	100.932	103.758	-1.6666666269302368	21	 And so (umm) I wouldn't really recommend it
11650	102.788	108.228	-1.0	22	 So if you're looking for a good action movie, try to go see something else because this one is just not worth it
11650	107.228	110.413	-2.3333332538604736	23	 So definitely stay away from Crank
11650	0.58	5.621	0.6666666865348816	1	 How's it going? My name is Jordan, and I'm going to be reviewing a movie today
11650	0.0	1.58	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey, you all
11650	6.976	13.064	0.0	3	 Now (umm) I don't know about you all, but I have seen tons and tons of advertisements for this movie
11650	4.621	7.477	0.0	2	 And that movie is called Crank
11650	20.345	27.461	-1.6666666269302368	5	 However, I got into the theater, and I started watching the movie and everything, and everything was extremely cheesy
11650	12.363	21.305	-0.3333333432674408	4	 And when I saw the advertisements, it looked like a really action-packed kind of (uhh) suspenseful movie that I thought I was really going to enjoy
11650	39.871	53.013	0.0	7	 So, basically, the entire movie, he's trying to keep his heartbeat up while trying to, you know, get back at the people who did this to him, say goodbye to his girlfriend, you know, tell the people that he, that he knows that he's dying and things like that
11650	27.269	40.152	0.0	6	 (uhh) Basically, it's about this guy who gets injected with this kind of serum or something that makes it so he cannot let his heartbeat drop below a certain rate and, or he'll die
11650	55.266	57.643	-1.6666666269302368	9	 There was a lot of plot holes
11650	52.253	56.266	-1.3333333730697632	8	 But (umm) a lot of the movie didn't really make sense
11650	71.808	78.785	-1.0	11	 However, if you're looking for a sophisticated action movie that make sense, then I would not recommend this
11650	56.882	72.808	0.3333333432674408	10	 I wouldn't really recommend it if you're kind of (uhh) if you like to think about things and, you know, if if (stutter) you're looking for just sheer blow-up stuff and, you know, things going fast and things blowing up, then I would definitely recommend seeing this movie
11650	80.129	82.696	-1.0	13	 I didn't really care for the main actor
11650	78.014	80.95	0.0	12	 (umm) The acting is only so-so
11650	83.601	86.068	-1.3333333730697632	15	 They all seem the same to me
11650	81.696	84.601	-2.0	14	 I never really cared for any of his movies
11650	88.7	92.693	-2.0	17	 I would not recommend it for people to go out and see it
11650	85.756	89.7	-2.0	16	 (uhh) But (umm) but (stutter) overall, I was not very happy with this movie
11650	96.133	98.949	0.3333333432674408	19	 The previews showed the best parts of the movie
11650	91.693	97.133	-2.3333332538604736	18	 I kind of wish I wouldn't have seen it, because the previews were better than the actual movie
119348	98.946	107.04	-1.3333333730697632	11	 And this is like four seasons or something of that, every episode and it's just no good
119348	85.547	99.478	-1.0	10	 (uhh) Just because we stopped relying as much on the old sitcom formula of girlfriend finds guy doing something that could look bad and of course they never talk it out and they always assume the worst and (stutter) oh man it drives me crazy
119348	111.987	115.052	-0.6666666865348816	13	 So I don't know

119348	0.361	27.98	0.3333333432674408	0	My old roommate back in college, (uhh) in an attempt to share common and bond with me would sometimes give me, you know, (umm) box sets of anime that he especially enjoyed and I've hung onto them over the years because I can't throw things away and one of said animes, you have to say it like an angry samurai ANIME, is (uhh) Ranma One Half
119348	31.869	39.045	1.0	3	 And the plot of this delightful little anime is that, oh I watched this, it's just been a few years
119348	28.347	31.931	0.0	2	 You just, you just (stutter) had Anma One Half, now you have Ranma

119348	64.096	83.923	-2.0	9	 She (umm), you know, blames him for things that aren't his fault and always catches him in compromising situations and I really think that Japanese cartoons at least, I can't say about TV, but Japanese cartoons are like ten, fifteen years behind (umm) my own obviously superior country's TV
119348	51.863	62.931	-2.0	8	 Also there's like seven-thousand love interests and the girl that he's obviously courting (stutter) in traditional Japanese style is a complete and utter not a good person

121358	104.743	107.579	-1.0	20	 So it's a little over the top for me
121358	107.387	115.461	0.6666666865348816	21	 (umm) It did win Best Supporting (stutter) Actress in nineteen eighty three and (uhh) it's a classic

121358	0.62	4.294	0.3333333432674408	1	 Today I'm reviewing the DVD Dune
121358	0.0	1.62	0.0	0	Hi, I'm Carolyn
121358	5.22	9.043	0.6666666865348816	3	 As it says on the front, A place beyond your dreams
121358	3.902	6.22	2.0	2	 Dune is quite an interesting DVD
121358	10.019	12.864	0.3333333432674408	5	 It's definitely way beyond my imagination
121358	8.043	10.45	1.0	4	 A movie beyond your imagination
121358	22.889	25.775	0.0	7	 So it is like science fiction
121358	12.224	23.889	-1.3333333730697632	6	 And the beginning started out really pretty good and then it just got kind of too crazy, with this weird music that was, like, super electric guitar or something, but it just got a little bit crazy
121358	34.004	35.573	0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) Let's see
121358	25.194	33.697	0.3333333432674408	8	 It is rated PG-thirteen for language and (uhh) a little bit of (uhh) kissing in there
121358	40.32	48.184	0.3333333432674408	11	 The director is if I can find it here for you, (uhh) David Lynch, who did The Elephant Man and Eraserhead
121358	34.573	40.821	0.3333333432674408	10	 It is Frank Herbert, classic science fiction epic was made into a movie
121358	52.642	54.55	0.6666666865348816	13	 So you're out in space
121358	47.184	53.642	0.0	12	 And basically, it's a story about (uhh) this intergalactic warrior
121358	58.858	64.816	0.0	15	 (uhh) and (uhh) Paul is the messianic rise to leadership
121358	53.649	59.419	-0.6666666865348816	14	 It starts off being narrated by one of the (stutter) space princesses or whatever
121358	85.727	95.167	1.6666666269302368	17	 And so, (stutter) on this land, on this other planet where the spice is harvested, they know that (uhh) the messiah will come
121358	63.816	86.248	0.3333333432674408	16	 So this guy named Paul, he's born of this woman who was only supposed to have daughters, but she has this son and he's supposed to, well, this other land that has this (umm) the spice, and this spice is what everybody wants in this intergalactic (uhh) you know, in this (umm) galaxy and this space (stutter) world
121358	96.781	105.683	0.0	19	 And then it just goes kind of kookie and just keeps going on and on, with cool (uhh) special effects and (uhh) powerful performances and images
121358	94.167	97.781	0.0	18	 So it's got a little religious undertones in it
122439	3.553	9.013	0.3333333432674408	1	 The animated movie about surfing penguins
122439	0.181	3.935	0.0	0	My review today is (umm) the movie Surf's Up
122439	20.295	25.845	1.6666666269302368	3	 He wants to go out and see the world and do some surfing
122439	9.699	20.826	0.0	2	 (umm) This movie starts out as a very there's a very young penguin, he's wanting to break free from where his family is
122439	36.917	41.799	0.6666666865348816	5	 Basically getting him started into the surfing world
122439	25.663	36.91	0.0	4	 Along the way, before he before he (stutter) leaves town, this surf guy comes into his town and gives him a necklace
122439	47.214	49.88	0.6666666865348816	7	 And be a big surfing star
122439	41.407	46.867	0.3333333432674408	6	 he he (stutter) in turn wants to go out and surf
122439	68.206	73.906	0.6666666865348816	9	 And everything turns out okay in the movie
122439	49.269	67.42	0.0	8	 So he, I don't exactly know what, where exactly he goes, but he runs across this (uhh) this big surfer guy that's supposedly (uhh) dies, and he learns to surf, surfs really well, wins a competition
122602	50.626	59.488	-1.0	11	 (umm) It's hokey, it's shallow, it's, it's not at all what you'd expect
122602	44.271	50.319	-1.0	10	 And so I go see Spider-Man three and once again I'm sorely disappointed
122602	69.284	75.592	-2.3333332538604736	13	 But (umm) Topher Grace from That seventies Show actually plays Venom, which I thought was a stupid choice
122602	58.488	69.735	-1.0	12	 Especially since (umm) they introduced Venom in it which had so many possibilities for it to be (umm) you know, another dark film, another more mature film
122602	77.585	82.925	-1.3333333730697632	15	 And they turn the movie just into just basically a big joke
122602	75.629	77.996	-1.3333333730697632	14	 (umm) He makes a really terrible Venom
122602	86.215	95.686	-2.6666667461395264	17	 It's really boring and (umm) I don't know, like I've forgotten most of the things in the film just because I didn't care about it that much
122602	83.282	87.215	-1.6666666269302368	16	 (umm) You don't care at all for the characters, you don't care at all for the story line
122602	95.185	104.965	-1.6666666269302368	18	 So I was sorely disappointed and (umm) I probably won't be go see the fourth Spider-Man because they completely lost me now
122602	6.776	9.432	1.0	1	 (umm) Hugely popular film
122602	1.348	6.788	0.0	0	This review is for a film currently in theaters called Spider-Man three
122602	14.429	17.384	0.0	3	 (umm) So this is where I stand with the Spider-Man movies
122602	10.348	14.042	0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) Big giant movie blockbuster trilogy
122602	18.689	23.071	-1.3333333730697632	5	 I thought it was kind of boring and hokey
122602	16.384	19.629	-1.3333333730697632	4	 Actually I didn't like the first one
122602	27.07	29.327	0.0	7	 I thought it was more mature
122602	24.705	27.671	2.0	6	 (umm) Really enjoyed the second one a lot
122602	32.158	44.153	2.0	9	 (uhh) I really liked Doc Ock (umm) He was a great villain and I really enjoyed Spider-Man two and actually, (uhh) it made up for Spider-Man one and I really couldn't wait for the third one to come out
122602	29.045	32.649	0.6666666865348816	8	 I thought it was deeper and had more of a message
122842	57.68	63.06	1.6666666269302368	11	 And Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, and this is just (uhh) a really awesome movie
122842	56.792	58.421	2.0	10	 It was really great
122842	62.06	64.258	1.3333333730697632	12	 Check it out if you haven't seen it
122842	6.058	9.362	3.0	1	 This is my favorite of all the Star Wars movies
122842	0.0	6.668	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, this review is for Star Wars The Empire Strikes back
122842	16.803	24.897	0.0	3	 There's a giant battle right starting off, (umm) these giant walkers, the AT-ATs come, and they attack everything, and they blow up their base and the rebels have to run
122842	8.941	17.594	0.0	2	 (umm) It's really dark kind of movie (umm) everything kind of starts going bad for the rebels, they get driven off their ice planet in the beginning
122842	34.164	38.217	0.0	5	 And then in the end he's forced to confront Vader
122842	24.346	35.164	0.0	4	 And then Luke Skywalker goes to be trained as a jedi (uhh) and he meets Yoda, and Yoda teaches him all about the force and how to use it and how to become a true jedi, and not succumb to the power of the dark side
122842	43.303	45.78	1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) Really intense movie, really cool
122842	37.546	43.156	0.0	6	 Vader traps his friends and and (stutter) lures him into a trap (umm) to try and take him to the emperor
122842	50.726	57.792	0.6666666865348816	9	 Frank Oz does the voice of Yoda, who Frank Oz has of course done Muppet movies and voices for all sorts of people
122842	44.78	51.317	1.6666666269302368	8	 Billy Dee Williams comes and (uhh) makes his appearance as Lando Calrissian, of course Carrie Fisher is in it
125708	0.74	20.886	0.0	0	Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD Movie {cough} this is easy money starring Rodney Dangerfield (umm) he is a comedian actor (umm) that did comedy back in the eighties and nineties and recently passed away a few years ago
125730	76.228	82.576	1.0	11	 It's a very high action movie and you know you could go along with most of it
125730	56.722	76.679	0.0	10	 He plays a young computer hacker who accidentally helps the (stutter) wrong people get some (umm) information and helps them try to destroy the US's (umm) whole computer system, everything going and John McClane comes to help you know, fix this problem and they work together and they solve it
125730	86.944	94.389	0.0	13	 But (umm) I mean as long as you're not expecting it to be totally realistic and you know you're in an action movie that's fine
125730	81.576	87.575	-1.0	12	 They had some helicopters and some freeway scenes that were just, you know, a little bit outrageous at one point
125730	99.016	103.309	1.6666666269302368	15	 I was on the edge of my seat and I thought it was very entertaining
125730	93.868	100.016	2.6666667461395264	14	 It was an excellent movie, I'd give it (umm) five stars because I was not bored one minute
125730	6.347	12.705	1.6666666269302368	1	 This is an action adventure thriller that was just, I mean there's no way you could be bored in this movie
125730	0.341	6.928	0.0	0	Hi, today I'm gonna (stutter) review the movie I recently saw in theater, it's Live Free or Die Hard
125730	14.049	18.482	0.0	3	 It stars Bruce Willis, he plays the part of John McClane
125730	12.084	14.551	2.3333332538604736	2	 I thought it was an excellent movie
125730	20.774	25.256	1.6666666269302368	5	 I had never seen the other shows, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one
125730	17.861	21.425	0.0	4	 This is the fourth in a series of shows
125730	42.934	52.624	0.0	7	 But there's a young guy played by Justin Long, and if you can't recognize who he is, he's in the (umm) Mac and (umm) PC commercial
125730	24.945	43.335	0.0	6	 It's (umm) rated PG-thirteen, it's a little over two hours long and it's basically about this old-fashioned cop who (umm) is used to doing things the hard way or the normal way as opposed to the younger generation who thinks everything has to be done through computers
125730	55.515	57.254	0.0	9	 But that's who it is
125730	51.624	56.515	-0.3333333432674408	8	 He plays the Mac and I kept thinking the whole movie you know, who is this guy
125845	70.262	73.596	0.6666666865348816	10	 So (umm) anyways, this is Cheaper by the Dozen
125845	11.266	21.644	0.6666666865348816	1	 (umm) This movie was put out in two-thousand-three and it was given to (umm) to me as a gift but but (stutter) you can purchase it at Walmart for fifteen dollars
125845	0.7	11.029	0.6666666865348816	0	I'm holding Cheaper by the Dozen DVD set starring Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling, and Hillary Duff
125845	24.925	38.077	1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) Steve Martin (uhh) and Bonny Hunt do a great a job acting, Steve Martin is hilarious as ever (umm) but it wasn't the best family movie in the world
125845	21.812	25.286	0.0	2	 (umm) This movie's okay, it's not my favorite
125845	47.513	56.824	1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) But (stutter) all the kids in the movie are great actors and great actresses, they really have a good cast, just think the writing could have been a little different
125845	37.077	46.298	-0.6666666865348816	4	 There were some things in there that just didn't really stick with me, I I (stutter) kind of thought they should have left it out for a family movie
125845	61.312	63.529	0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) It's rated PG
125845	55.944	61.045	-1.3333333730697632	6	 So if you're looking for, you know, a clean family film this isn't really it
125845	66.72	71.102	1.0	9	 (umm) I've also seen it at Target so you can buy it there for about the same price
125845	63.168	67.021	0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) Again you can buy it at Walmart for fifteen dollars
125895	7.125	23.62	0.3333333432674408	1	 This film tells the story of Mia Thermopolis who is a gawky and odd teenager who lives in San Francisco yet finds out that she is princess to the throne of Genovia, a European country
125895	0.291	7.427	2.0	0	I'm holding the hilarious movie The Princess Diaries, starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews
125895	33.026	43.136	0.0	3	 This movie was purchased at Walmart for fifteen dollars but you can also find it at Target or online at DisneyDVD dot com
125895	23.897	33.268	0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) Julie Andrews stars as the queen and who comes and tells Mia the secret that was kept from her her (stutter) whole life
125895	45.109	49.471	1.3333333730697632	5	 I think it's great for girls and I think it's great for teenagers
125895	43.143	46.059	2.0	4	 (umm) This is a great movie
125895	50.876	53.901	1.6666666269302368	7	 So if my brothers watch it, you know it's a good movie
125895	49.449	51.826	0.0	6	 (umm) My brothers even watch this
125895	61.372	63.679	2.3333332538604736	9	 So, highly recommend it
125895	53.679	61.933	2.6666667461395264	8	 (umm) It is rated G and I give it five stars because I just think it's wonderful
126542	55.405	62.901	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) I I (stutter) Yeah this is one of those movies where definitely video games should not be made in the (uhh) movies
126542	52.372	56.086	-2.3333332538604736	10	 (umm) Overall, I'd say it's probably not worth it to see this movie
126542	63.497	67.111	-1.6666666269302368	13	 Not they don't make great movies, not enough plot in them
126542	62.04	64.058	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Too hard to follow
126542	70.94	73.397	0.6666666865348816	15	 (umm) The fight scenes were all right
126542	67.019	71.032	-1.6666666269302368	14	 (umm) So yeah, and the acting, overall, not very great
126542	78.244	80.59	-2.0	17	 (stutter) I probably wouldn't even rent this movie
126542	72.397	79.054	-1.3333333730697632	16	 They're semi decent, but still (umm) nothing, nothing (stutter) good
126542	6.197	12.805	0.0	1	 (umm) It's kind of like a, it's halfway of a parody, halfway serious movie
126542	0.0	6.629	0.0	0	Alright this review is for Dead or Alive, the movie (umm) based off the video game
126542	19.437	22.293	0.0	3	 (umm) It's a martial arts movie
126542	12.653	19.03	0.0	2	 (umm) It doesn't it doesn't (stutter) try to be too serious but it also isn't a comedy or anything like that
126542	28.756	35.234	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) and they it's basically just an excuse to have martial arts and CG in a movie
126542	21.742	28.619	0.0	4	 (umm) Type of movie that basically stars (umm) four four four (stutter) of the people from the game
126542	45.039	48.074	-1.6666666269302368	7	 But it's not nothing believable
126542	35.191	46.039	-1.0	6	 (umm) Basically they just screw around (uhh) go around beating people up, getting in fights (umm) showing off, doing the ninja thing and then (uhh) there's a little bit of a plot thrown in
126542	49.489	52.325	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) Yeah there's a lot of holes in the plot
126542	47.074	49.541	-0.3333333432674408	8	 Not even very easy to follow
126831	54.488	56.475	-2.3333332538604736	11	 It's not, I don't like it
126831	48.571	54.839	-2.3333332538604736	10	 (umm) But even if you're by yourself or with some friends or with anybody you probably still won't like it
126831	57.361	61.783	-1.3333333730697632	13	 But (umm) you might like it, I didn't
126831	55.475	57.164	-2.3333332538604736	12	 It's not that good
126831	64.185	66.293	-2.3333332538604736	15	 Yeah, one out of five
126831	62.509	64.607	-3.0	14	 (uhh) One out of five maybe
126831	76.378	79.114	0.0	17	 So there you have it
126831	66.79	76.719	-2.3333332538604736	16	 (umm) So (umm) Cashback not too great, so go see it for yourself and see what you think (umm) but I'm going to give it one out of five
126831	2.306	6.738	-1.6666666269302368	1	 (umm) I have a movie review for you today, and it's not very good
126831	0.011	2.288	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey expo
126831	11.625	17.693	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) Not much to say about this movie, it had had (stutter) a pretty weak story line I think
126831	6.816	10.151	0.0	2	 (uhh) The movie that I'm reviewing is Cashback
126831	20.674	26.274	-1.0	5	 I don't know, it it (stutter) didn't seem like it, movie itself didn't seem like it was together too well
126831	17.911	21.674	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (uhh) Characters were a little bit (umm) shaky
126831	35.61	38.097	-2.0	7	 (umm) I wouldn't pay to see it again
126831	27.728	35.423	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) I don't know, it was a lot of just unnecessary things that just made it kind of played out and annoying
126831	40.849	48.454	-1.0	9	 Not family movie (umm) as you might know it's rated R, so obviously it's probably not a family movie
126831	38.863	41.11	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) Really wasn't that great
127470	52.492	55.897	-1.0	11	 So I mean I definitely wouldn't suggest this
127470	46.496	53.492	0.0	10	 (umm) I mean it does have it's (stutters) a few funny points, (umm) but they're scattered few and far between
127470	54.897	57.114	-0.3333333432674408	12	 It's definitely not a kids movie
127470	5.15	9.582	0.0	1	 (umm) This is the (umm) third movie in the (umm) American Pie series
127470	0.919	4.893	0.0	0	HI, I'm here to review (uhh) American Wedding DVD
127470	13.63	26.773	-0.3333333432674408	3	 He (umm) he decides to marry this girl (umm) Michelle who was in the (umm) the (uhh) very first movie and (umm) movie's definitely not as good as the (uhh) first one
127470	9.5	13.982	0.0	2	 (umm) It's about (umm) about Jason Biggs character (umm) Jim
127470	28.327	31.203	-0.3333333432674408	5	 This one also doesn't really make the cut
127470	26.78	29.088	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) Second one wasn't that great either
127470	35.63	38.107	-1.0	7	 (umm) I mean like I said, it's not a good movie
127470	31.071	34.515	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (umm) It's just a lot of (umm) crude crude humor
127470	42.974	45.73	-1.0	9	 (umm) I don't know, I didn't really like it that much
127470	37.885	42.537	-2.0	8	 (umm) I definitely wouldn't suggest it for anyone
127539	7.594	19.779	0.0	1	 (umm) You may know him from (uhh) from All That when he was (uhh) when he was younger, and (uhh) now more recently he's been (uhh) starring in his own show on MTV called (uhh) Wild and Out
127539	1.139	6.539	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hi I'm here to review (uhh) Drumline DVD starring Nick Cannon
127539	31.709	33.927	-2.0	3	 (umm) He's not a very good movie
127539	20.046	32.121	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) Nick Cannon is pretty funny guy but (um) you know when it comes to playing a serious role as this, (uhh) he's, he doesn't (uhh) doesn't really cut it very well
127539	39.332	44.742	0.0	5	 (umm) Like whole black college (uhh) band battles
127539	33.994	39.065	1.0	4	 (uhh) I mean it is good if you like watching the (um) the whole band and everything
127539	51.494	58.411	-2.0	7	 The (uhh) the dialog isn't that great, the (uhh) storyline is is (stutter) pretty predictable, pretty cheesy you know
127539	45.438	51.866	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) But I mean, really the movie's only good for those scenes where they're actually doing their (uhh) their battling
127539	68.366	71.89	-1.0	9	 So all in all, don't get this (uhh) Drumline DVD
127539	58.578	68.598	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (uhh) So I mean I wouldn't suggest this unless you were just watching it just to watch the (uhh) the bands, but I mean you can do that any you know college football game
12812	4.98	10.041	2.3333332538604736	1	 (umm) It's a very exciting film starring Charlize Theron and Edward Norton
12812	0.5	5.361	0.0	0	This DVD I have here is entitled the Italian Job
12812	16.205	29.886	1.6666666269302368	3	 There is a very exciting scene where they're all driving Minis, Mini Coopers, and there's a bunch of stuff in it and they're going through all these little alleyways and down stairs, places Minis wouldn't drive and it's really cool
12812	10.557	16.756	2.6666667461395264	2	 (umm) I really loved it, it's kind of an action movie and usually I don't like action movies that much
12812	34.064	36.511	1.3333333730697632	5	 It's very exciting
12812	29.205	35.064	2.0	4	 The boys thought that car was cool so (umm) it's a great movie if you like that car
12812	35.94	49.611	2.3333332538604736	6	 (umm) {clears throat} I think there's been great reviews (stutter) about this movie and it's very (umm) fun to watch with friends and I have always had a fun time watching it
128258	47.344	50.489	-2.0	11	 (umm) The story got even worse I thought
128258	41.417	47.855	-1.6666666269302368	10	 They were completely unbelievable and over the top and just not really that fun to watch
128258	53.62	61.683	-1.0	13	 (umm) But I would say if you've seen the first two movies already you might as well give it a watch just to finish up the trilogy and be done with it
128258	49.489	53.243	-1.6666666269302368	12	 It just I don't really know where they were going with it
128258	60.883	69.117	-2.0	14	 But otherwise (umm) I really think you could pass on this and not be missing anything
128258	5.738	16.746	-1.3333333730697632	1	 This is the third chapter, third and final chapter, in the Matrix trilogy and I would say by far my least favorite of the three
128258	0.73	6.18	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, this is Dave and this is my review of The Matrix Revolutions
128258	18.31	19.988	2.0	3	 I enjoyed it
128258	16.364	19.25	1.3333333730697632	2	 (uhh) The first movie, I thought was really good
128258	20.944	23.989	-2.0	5	 The second movie, not so much
128258	19.866	21.944	1.6666666269302368	4	 (uhh) it was very original
128258	28.098	32.959	-2.6666667461395264	7	 But story wise it was a big disappointment over the first one
128258	23.398	28.459	0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) It still had some redeeming qualities like I did enjoy the action sequences quite a bit
128258	37.067	42.417	-2.6666667461395264	9	 (uhh) The action sequences I thought were didn't even hold up
128258	32.597	37.638	-2.6666667461395264	8	 And Matrix Revolutions, the third one, really gets even worse
128752	46.875	51.477	0.0	11	 Trying not to, trying to get (stutter) him focused on school and everything
128752	43.592	46.947	-1.0	10	 Of course, his father is over protective
128752	55.106	58.59	-2.0	13	 But (umm), like I said, I didn't really like it
128752	51.115	55.717	-1.6666666269302368	12	 And (umm) you know, it wasn't that that (stutter) funny of a movie
128752	61.312	66.253	-1.0	15	 So, I mean, all in all I wouldn't suggest getting, getting (stutter) this DVD
128752	57.59	61.663	-0.3333333432674408	14	 Of course, it's a old movie, so that, that (stutter) could be it also
128752	65.253	67.43	-2.0	16	 It's definitely not worth the money
128752	5.05	7.227	-1.0	1	 (umm) I didn't really like this movie
128752	0.281	3.985	0.0	0	{noise} Hi, I'm here to review the (umm) House Party DVD
128752	9.809	15.219	0.0	3	 (umm) It's about (umm) this guy, Kid, he (uhh) he's played by Christopher Reid
128752	6.616	10.011	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (uhh) It's a old old-school movie
128752	25.952	28.758	0.6666666865348816	5	 And (uhh) then he meets this guy, Play
128752	15.127	26.194	0.0	4	 {noise} He's basically a (umm) a nerdy kid, comes to (uhh) comes to live in this in a rough neighborhood and (uhh) he's trying to learn the ropes, trying to be cool
128752	30.213	34.685	0.0	7	 And they (uhh) you know, try try (stutter) to make it up in the world
128752	28.187	30.484	0.0	6	 And they become Kid and Play
128752	38.893	44.592	-0.3333333432674408	9	 And there's some people who (umm) who are trying, you know, like spoil their fun and everything
128752	33.994	39.893	0.0	8	 And they (uhh) try to throw a big house party, like have lots of fun and everything
128949	12.952	25.795	-1.3333333730697632	1	 Well, unfortunately all the funny parts were apparently in the trailer (umm) and I say that only because there were other funny parts in the movie but it was all those like obvious funny parts
128949	0.0	13.722	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi, this is gonna be a review of the movie of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and this is one of those movie when I saw the trailer, I was all happy seeing to see that movie because it looks so hilarious in the trailer
128949	33.974	38.945	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) There were too many obvios jokes and I felt there was a lot of stereotypes
128949	26.751	34.366	0.0	2	 (umm) It was the type of humor that would appeal to an eight year old boy but that's what I should expect from an Adam Sandler comedy
128949	56.782	62.611	-0.3333333432674408	5	 I just felt like all the jokes were already used in the trailers so that was a little disappointing to me
128949	38.544	57.782	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) I felt it went from a lot of stereotypes to a lot of trying to force an after school special kind of movie on this (umm) and (umm) it just felt too unbelievable from going from stereotypes to trying to send a message so (umm) it, there were some funny jokes in there
128949	64.136	68.019	-1.0	7	 (umm) It wasn't as funny as I had hoped it would be
128949	61.711	63.988	2.3333332538604736	6	 It was a funny movie
128949	68.476	76.47	-1.0	8	 (uhh) It's one of those movie that you should definitely, you would be better off when it come out in DVD though it definitely wasn't worth going to see it at the movie theater
129733	71.549	80.531	-2.0	11	 (umm) Like I said I'm a huge fan of Will Smith and (uhh) (stutter) basically everything he's been in, but (uhh) this is just (uhh) this wasn't a good movie
129733	65.812	70.124	-2.0	10	 So I give this movie a two out of five
129733	6.946	14.161	0.6666666865348816	1	 And while I'm actually usually a pretty big fan of (umm) Will Smith movies because I think he's, you know, he's a good actor
129733	0.131	6.539	0.0	0	This is Wild Wild West and it stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Selma Hayek
129733	17.99	22.333	-2.0	3	 (umm) This was (uhh) basically just not a good movie
129733	14.039	18.083	-1.6666666269302368	2	 But (uhh) you know even he couldn't save this movie
129733	24.166	31.412	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) A lot of the like you know a lot of the little gadgets that they through into the movie and you know were just bad ideas
129733	21.333	23.73	-1.3333333730697632	4	 I mean the plot was terrible
129733	38.913	49.371	0.0	7	 But (umm) I mean (stutter) you think with actually a you know a somewhat decent cast that they pull off a you know, better movie but they don't
129733	33.056	39.474	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (umm) I mean I guess it's entertaining to watch once or once you know like ever and (stutter) just to see how bad it was
129733	53.61	66.812	-1.3333333730697632	9	 There's a you know behind the scenes documentaries, Will Smith and Enrique Eglasias (uhh) music videos, director commentary and you know they threw in a whole bunch of stuff but you know it doesn't really make the movie you know it doesn't make the movie any better
129733	51.494	54.61	0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) (uhh) Yeah (uhh) There's a whole bunch of special features
130149	6.976	19.679	-1.0	1	 Don't ask me why I got this, but I thought it would be (umm) fun because it has a character that plays Gomer Pyle in it, and Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, and I thought it would be a good movie
130149	0.0	6.788	1.3333333730697632	0	I'm gonna do a review on The (stutter) Best Little Whore House in Texas
130149	26.012	28.539	0.0	3	 (umm) I'm not sure when it was even made
130149	19.238	25.745	0.0	2	 Don't get me wrong, it it it (stutter) has it's moments, but it's an older movie
130149	30.572	87.525	-1.3333333730697632	5	 Anyways, I don't know (uhh) Pretty much it's it's (stutter) about this cop, and there's this whore house and they want to get it shut down and the cop is sleeping with the owner of the whore house and you know, she wants him to be on her side and he, it it's (stutter) an it's a weird movie and yeah it has funny moments and stuff but it just it just (stutter) doesn't keep me involved throughout the movie because I I (stutter)just know that I it's just weird and I'll probably won't watch this again and I can't recommend someone watch this because it's just, maybe for the (uhh) someone that's older than me that has seen it in the past or watched shows like that in the past
130149	29.305	31.572	0.0	4	 (uhh) It says a release date
130149	86.525	91.186	-1.6666666269302368	6	 They they (stutter) might enjoy it but (umm) I, no, I didn't like it
130426	9.23	13.473	-1.3333333730697632	1	 (uhh) I would give it probably two stars out of five
130426	0.64	9.702	-2.0	0	(uhh) This is The Matrix Revolutions (umm) the third installment in the Wachowski brothers matrix trilogy, and definitely the worst
130426	16.943	20.766	-2.0	3	 (umm) It goes way too heavy on the Jesus references
130426	13.271	16.566	-1.3333333730697632	2	 (uhh) I only bought this movie to complete the series
130426	28.846	34.136	1.6666666269302368	5	 And what made the first two movies great was like, the kung fu and hand to hand action
130426	20.744	29.427	-2.3333332538604736	4	 (umm) There's just Neo in there, trying to save the world again and stuff and just way too heavy on the Jesus references, I hated that
130426	40.859	46.338	-2.0	7	 And I I (stutter) just didn't get why they didn't stop after the second one
130426	33.605	41.38	-2.0	6	 And in this movie, it's all done with machines, and it's just not nearly as cool it it (stutter) gets rather stupid
130426	45.887	60.416	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It (uhh) like the agents once again are multiplying, big surprise, and {sigh} it's just all these machines going on and (stutter) just not the human emotion that were, that was in the first two
130448	4.9	8.175	-0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) This movie I really bought just on a whim
130448	0.59	4.633	1.0	0	Hi, this is my review of the movie The Chronicles of Riddick
130448	21.892	25.246	1.6666666269302368	3	 So I figured it'd probably be pretty good so I picked it up
130448	7.335	22.892	1.0	2	 I had seen the original movie starring Riddick (uhh) which is Pitch Black and I really enjoyed that movie so when this came out it looked like just a big epic movie featuring (uhh) the same characters
130448	32.049	35.563	-2.3333332538604736	5	 It's kind of just an instantly forgettable action movie
130448	26.252	33.049	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) Visually, it's really (uhh) pretty incredible movie but the story was kind of a let down
130448	42.924	50.04	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) So I really can't recommend it although I did enjoy the previous movie, Pitch Black, which you might wanna check out
130448	35.141	41.709	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (uhh) I wasn't that impressed with it and I probably would not have bought it if I had seen it before I picked it up
130448	53.739	65.914	-0.3333333432674408	9	 But (uhh) if you do wanna check it out, just keep in mind that (uhh) the original was rated R I believe and this is an unrated version which (uhh) would definitely be inappropriate for children
130448	50.676	54.669	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) Yeah, so I would say for the most part, you can skip this
130633	70.731	74.395	3.0	10	 (uhh) the actors are great, storyline is great
130633	7.554	15.748	0.6666666865348816	1	 This film comes (uhh) from Korea and it is highly regarded as (uhh) just a great film overall
130633	0.371	4.982	0.0	0	Alright (uhh) this is going to be a review of a foreign film Old Boy
130633	26.062	33.428	0.0	3	 (uhh) Dae-Su is a Korean man who one day gets locked up in this hotel room
130633	15.696	25.895	0.0	2	 (uhh) I'm not, I can't go into the plot or the storyline without giving anything away, without giving (stutter) any spoilers away, but I can set up the story
130633	37.756	52.484	0.0	5	 And the rest of the film involves him trying to find out why he got locked up, who did this to him, and he tries to see if he can exact revenge on the person who (uhh) who jailed him for fifteen years
130633	32.428	38.526	0.0	4	 He is basically jailed for fifteen years and he doesn't know why
130633	55.944	61.005	2.3333332538604736	7	 If you're not into foreign films, you probably will be after watching this
130633	52.293	56.106	2.0	6	 (uhh) this a wonderful (uhh) masterpiece
130633	69.463	71.491	3.0	9	 It is done great
130633	60.783	70.024	1.3333333730697632	8	 (uhh) I recommend watching it in the dubbed, (uhh) not the dubbed but the subtitled version (uhh) just to get the the (stutter) entire effect, the entire feel of it
131650	56.842	59.379	-2.0	10	 I would not recommend buying it
131650	5.409	16.526	1.6666666269302368	1	 It is the Blair Witch Project Two, Book of Shadows, and Blair Witch Project One, I know a lot of people didn't really like it, but I thought it was pretty good
131650	0.0	5.741	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, my name is Emma and today I'm going to review this DVD that I got
131650	19.327	26.034	-1.3333333730697632	3	 But this movie has absolutely nothing to do with The Blair Witch Project One
131650	15.526	19.839	1.0	2	 It scared me a little bit, which is rare with a scary movie
131650	41.687	44.912	-0.3333333432674408	5	 I don't even think it was directed by the same person
131650	25.673	42.307	-2.3333332538604736	4	 You know, none of the same actors, hardly even the same plot, and a lot of really, really random weird stuff that makes absolutely no sense like, you know, I wouldn't even be so angry about it if they had called it something different because it's clearly not The Blair Witch Project
131650	51.165	53.612	1.0	7	 You know, I hadn't seen the movie yet
131650	44.67	51.556	-0.3333333432674408	6	 I got this DVD at Best Buy for about (umm) twelve dollars I think
131650	55.735	57.533	-3.0	9	 It was awful
131650	52.672	56.545	-2.6666667461395264	8	 I like The Blair Witch Project, thought I'd like this too, but I didn't
131871	5.08	14.122	-2.0	1	 (umm) I only watch this movie online but I really thought this plot was kind of (umm) was very (uhh) not well thought out
131871	0.0	5.541	0.0	0	This is a review for Black Sheep, which came out this year in New Zealand
131871	29.824	38.307	0.0	3	 (umm) Henry Old Oldfield (stutter) was coming back from a psychiatric institute which (umm) was treating him because of his fear of sheeps
131871	14.169	29.786	0.0	2	 (umm) It was basically about (umm) It was basically about (uhh) a man named Henry Oldfield and he returns home to his brother Angus Oldfield Oldfield(stutter), who is doing giant experiments on sheep
131871	50.078	57.104	0.0	5	 (umm) Basically it was just Henry's (umm) nightmare (uhh) came to life
131871	37.815	50.0	0.0	4	 And (uhh) he came back to Angus and he found out that Angus had (umm) released a genetically engineered sheep that turned them into that turned the sheep into blood thirsty sheep
131871	69.104	74.514	0.0	7	 So basically they had to find a way to save New Zealand and avoid these sheep
131871	56.842	69.705	0.0	6	 Overall, (umm) it was just basically this movie was basically about how Henry Angus had to avoid these deadly sheep which (umm) this one sheep turned more thousands into blood thirsty sheeps
131871	74.692	82.327	-2.0	8	 (uhh) Personally I thought this movie, the plot was kind of lacking and it wasn't very fulfilling in my eyes
131936	11.385	22.842	-0.6666666865348816	1	 (umm) This one features voice actors such as Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and even director Martin Scorsese
131936	0.0	11.228	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, today I'd like to review Shark Tale on DVD, and this was another of the many animated movies
131936	26.391	39.334	0.0	3	 It it's got a pretty generic story about some fish and it (umm) features a real musical sequences to popular seventies songs
131936	24.745	27.391	0.0	2	 (umm) This was an entertaining enough movie
131936	49.788	64.487	-1.0	5	 Plus it just used the voice acting cast to gain popularity even though it's kind of distracting in that you just kind of hear the celebrities but not the characters
131936	38.883	50.13	-1.3333333730697632	4	 But overall I found it to be just kind if generic and it was just made to capitalize on the popularity of movies like Shrek or Toy Story
131936	79.191	96.065	-1.3333333730697632	7	 So (umm) overall I think I'd recommend this for kids cause I think they'd probably enjoy it, but otherwise (umm) I wouldn't recommend it because it's just pretty generic and lazy and not that interesting
131936	65.732	80.191	0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) DVD does have a good bit of special features (umm) that kids will enjoy like bloopers and interactive things about the music and the special effects and interviews with the cast
134252	1.997	6.449	0.0	1	 This is a review for the (uhh) Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood
134252	1.508	2.757	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
134252	10.318	13.533	-1.0	3	 I don't actually see how this applies to this movie
134252	5.728	11.178	0.3333333432674408	2	 The catchphrase for this movie is mothers, daughters, the never ending story of good versus evil
134252	16.364	22.403	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (uhh) It lacked really any kind of (uhh) draw that some chick flicks might have for men
134252	12.663	16.825	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) I didn't really find that this movie was very entertaining
134252	27.289	51.656	-1.6666666269302368	7	 It does happen to have some very tragic and downright (umm) depressing moments in the movie, (uhh) especially with the fact that the mother and the daughter that are the main characters, Sandra Bullock and whatever her mom's name is, (umm) they (uhh) have this rift between them and the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which is the sworn lifelong friends of Vivi, who is Sandra Bullock, (uhh) have decided to have this intervention so that they can bring mother and daughter back together
134252	22.111	27.81	0.0	6	 (umm) This movie's definitely just for girls and it (uhh), you know, you need to have a Kleenex box alongside with you
134252	56.523	64.856	-2.0	9	 (umm) The title (uhh) obviously the sunflower that you see on the cover here is a little misleading cause the movie overall is rather depressing
134252	51.405	56.296	0.0	8	 (uhh) It seems like an impossible task but of course because a chick flick it obviously works out
136205	64.176	71.162	-1.6666666269302368	11	 Thought it was quite fast paced and yeah I just, I couldn't enjoy the movie
136205	47.833	64.058	-1.3333333730697632	10	 In the books she's a very interesting character, but yet on the big screen, yeah she loses it I feel and most of the magic was in the imagination, well that's what it seems to be because (stutter) I just couldn't get into this movie
136205	74.083	87.445	-1.3333333730697632	13	 And the characters try their best to act, but yeah, xxx the story just (stutter) was missing something, that kind of Nancy Drew magic and well it kind of broke my heart
136205	70.731	74.195	-0.6666666865348816	12	 Which is sad because I was really looking forward to it
136205	97.709	102.211	-1.3333333730697632	15	 Go in with low expectations and you might enjoy this
136205	87.423	98.53	-0.3333333432674408	14	 So if you also loved Nancy Drew as I did as a child then, well, you could try and watch this but be prepared for disappointment
136205	5.0	9.352	-0.3333333432674408	1	 Well, Andrew Fleming is the director, and yeah
136205	0.051	5.591	0.0	0	My review now is for the movie Nancy Drew, by Andrew Fleming
136205	15.267	20.028	1.0	3	 I read the Nancy Drew books as a child, and yeah I thought they were really good
136205	8.981	16.007	0.3333333432674408	2	 So those who are of course childhood fans, I am as I suppose
136205	27.1	32.19	-1.0	5	 Movies from books are often, well, rushed
136205	20.495	27.671	-0.6666666865348816	4	 And when I heard there was a movie coming out I was skeptical, which is not too surprising
136205	33.665	38.646	-0.3333333432674408	7	 Lord of the Rings, for one, and yeah
136205	31.35	34.066	-0.6666666865348816	6	 Of course, there are exceptions
136205	40.709	47.945	-0.3333333432674408	9	 I know Nancy Drew doesn't really make her appearance on the big screen quite as well as she does in the books
136205	37.646	39.933	0.0	8	 This one was hmm
136211	8.871	22.443	0.0	1	 Live Free or Die Hard and obviously this is starring Bruce Willis and of course I forget the rest of the characters I always forget names, but Live Free or Die Hard is exactly what it sounds like
136211	1.777	9.213	1.6666666269302368	0	Hello ExpoTV, today I have another great (umm) review for a movie currently in theaters
136211	30.751	37.488	-0.6666666865348816	3	 It's basically the summer's action hit before Transformers came out
136211	21.473	31.412	2.0	2	 It's a mantra for an action movie and if you love the rest of the Die Hards and you've seen them and you have Die Hard movie nights like I've had, you're gonna love it
136211	56.174	62.571	1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) It's definitely something that is worth the money you got, you've got (stutter) to see the rest of the Die Hards
136211	37.356	55.597	2.6666667461395264	4	 But Live Free or Die Hard basically if you're like me, if you love to see stuff blowing up, cars flipping in the air, shoot them up, everything like that, if it Bruce Willis is crazy and hardcore as usual, (umm) just like the rest of them, it definitely won't disappoint
136211	65.932	72.649	1.0	7	 (umm) It's a perfect edition, and basically if you love the rest of the Die Hards don't even hesitate, go out and see it
136211	61.611	66.293	1.6666666269302368	6	 I would definitely, I can't wait until it comes out on DVD and we get out the collection and have another movie night
136215	60.703	66.892	0.6666666865348816	11	 I though (umm) they kind of set her out as sort of like the books are Nancy Drew
136215	59.636	61.703	1.3333333730697632	10	 Which is kind of interesting
136215	76.128	86.906	0.0	13	 But (umm) really I mean you have as much depth as a kids movie has and I mean, it's basically you know a kid's spy series
136215	66.58	76.719	0.3333333432674408	12	 (umm) She was kind of old fashioned and all the way she dressed and she is very conservative and compared to the newer kids and I thought that was an interesting contrast which the younger kids I don't think would pick up on
136215	85.976	95.397	-1.0	14	 So, I mean for younger kids I think it's great but for older audiences, I mean again it's a good family movie but (umm) definitely not a blockbuster hit
136215	2.865	9.722	2.0	1	 Today I have another great movie for only in theater review for you and that is Nancy Drew
136215	1.059	3.815	0.0	0	Hello Expo TV
136215	15.536	32.051	0.0	3	 (umm) I took my younger brother and sister to go see it and they loved it so I guess it's more of a preteen (uhh) adolescent kid movie than for (umm) young adults and adults
136215	9.889	15.419	-2.0	2	 Nancy Drew, to be honest, I really didn't like at all
136215	41.238	45.071	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) It's basically like the Nancy Drew books
136215	32.308	41.499	1.0	4	 (umm) I would say if you're babysitting and you wanna get the kids, they wanna see a movie xxx like that, Nancy Drew (umm) would be good for that
136215	49.499	53.921	0.0	7	 (umm) And I mean she's solving mysteries
136215	44.58	49.012	0.6666666865348816	6	 The girl she's a detective and (umm) and she's really good
136215	54.727	60.526	-0.6666666865348816	9	 She doesn't really fit in (umm) with the current times, the current kids
136215	52.921	55.727	0.3333333432674408	8	 She's a little bit of an oddball
137827	4.99	8.255	1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm) I picked up because I really liked the book
137827	1.388	5.561	0.3333333432674408	0	(uhh) The movie Derailed based on a book by James Sigel
137827	19.208	30.365	-2.0	3	 (umm) Xzibit has failed to impress me with his acting ability as most rappers who attempt to (uhh) succeed in the movie industry tend to do
137827	7.564	18.761	-1.6666666269302368	2	 However (umm) I should have known with Xzibit being one of the featured actors that the acting and the, the general dialogue was gonna be awful
137827	40.31	57.982	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (umm) If you're looking for a mindless thrill this may be it for you, however it is lacking a little on the thrill part and all the Hollywood cliches are here, everything from the fake ending (umm) to the way that the characters are portrayed
137827	31.939	39.683	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) The first twenty minutes, half hour, work pretty well and then the movie just loses all coherence
137827	58.468	68.428	-2.6666667461395264	6	 (umm) The acting's subpar, the screen the screenplay (stutter) is disappointing and the directing is awful
139006	144.403	153.046	-2.3333332538604736	11	 They relied on a lot of chance events that feels really like forced and feel very unrealistic
139006	131.612	145.303	-2.0	10	 I think one of the things that kind of bothered me is that when they brought the character back, the way they did that was really annoying because they relied on the children (umm) the characters as being really idiotic
139006	152.046	182.239	-2.6666667461395264	12	 It's like you're looking at the movie, you're like, screaming at the movie like what the heck, like, that's so stupid, like no normal human with normal intelligence would do that, so it's like, when you, (stutter) there's certain parts, like in the beginning where you're just like how could they do that and it just feels so that like the film maker ran out of ideas so they used some cheap idea to, you know, create some drama to (stutter) bring the zombies into the film
139006	16.215	22.493	0.6666666865348816	1	 (umm) I'm actually quite intrigued with the kind of like modern-day zombie movies
139006	0.331	16.546	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi, this is my movie review of the movie (umm) Twenty-Eight Weeks Later and (umm) first of all, I have to say, I saw the first movie, Twenty-Eight Days Later, and I thought it was actually quite intriguing despite being really nasty
139006	28.985	35.603	-0.6666666865348816	3	 Basically, zombie movies, (umm) nowadays zombie movies are based on one concept
139006	21.532	29.337	-1.0	2	 I've seen almost every one of them from the pretty good one to the mediocre one to the really really bad one
139006	38.234	84.322	0.3333333432674408	5	 They basically have some type of virus that they have and then they bite people and then they infect people and then they all have you know the walking dead I'm gonna bite people (umm) virus, and Twenty-Eight Days Later explored that (umm) and it was set in England and this movie's also set in in (stutter) the United Kingdom and it's basically that they sealed off after the first attack and (umm) America and the United Nations are opening up Great Britain, they're cleaning up the mess (umm) because they think all the zombies have died or has been fire bombed and exterminated, so they go (umm) try to bring, resettle Great Britain with the people who survived and people who escaped
139006	34.603	38.875	-0.6666666865348816	4	 Now it doesn't matter if they call it differently, they're the same
139006	100.762	110.542	0.6666666865348816	7	 (umm) but one of the twist is that (umm) the movie is that they find the mom and (umm) that's where the story begins
139006	84.31	100.595	-0.6666666865348816	6	 And the story starts out with a family, and (umm) the father's reunited reunited (stutter) with (umm) the brother and the sister, and basically (umm) they're really shattered that you know their mom died
139006	116.197	132.612	0.3333333432674408	9	 I think the mom coming back and she's being really you know advertised in the trailers as (umm) being really important person, and she is a very important person (umm) in this movie
139006	110.57	116.659	0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) I think I think (stutter) the movie was it's okay in terms of plot
139032	102.189	111.201	-1.6666666269302368	11	 I couldn't wait to not watch the movie and (stutter)I mean I just wanted to fast forward and see what happens in the end
139032	97.37	103.189	-2.3333332538604736	10	 I didn't even, in the end of the movie, I was like {sigh} relieved that the movie was done you know
139032	141.42	151.509	-2.0	13	 If you're that big of a fan so Cillian Murphy maybe, but overall the movie had like, (stutter) it was just like really limited
139032	110.56	142.42	-1.6666666269302368	12	 And in the end it was very predictable it was like, and there was, basically there were some parts of the movie where they questioned like you know (stutter) how mentally you know ill the people on board the (umm) spacecraft and you know, that's that's (stutter) a really old concept and it's been overdone in so many movies and I just feel like that's just one of the most boring film I've seen this year so I absolutely don't recommend it
139032	152.974	160.918	-2.0	15	 I thought because they were on a spaceship it really limited like the story telling and it was just really bad
139032	150.509	153.804	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I don't really think they got creative
139032	161.933	168.361	-2.0	17	 It's not, you know, good in space or at least not good action not, it's just (stutter) bad
139032	159.918	162.863	-2.6666667461395264	16	 It's not good science fiction
139032	20.076	24.688	-1.0	1	 (umm) I think the movie has been a little bit overrated
139032	0.301	19.948	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, this is my movie review of the movie, Sunshine and this is a movie that stars Cillian Murphy and (umm) Chris Evans as people who from the Earth (umm) who realize that the sun is dying and they are trying to send a payload to the sun to rejuice the sun
139032	25.992	35.473	-1.6666666269302368	3	 I think it wasn't as good as (umm) I don't think it's as good as like any science fiction movie
139032	24.516	26.992	-2.6666667461395264	2	 (umm) I didn't like the movie at all
139032	58.558	75.632	-2.0	5	 The majority of the problem was the movie didn't really have a good plot (umm) as advertised as being cool you know and directed by the same person who did twenty-eight days later and you know, stars Cillian Murphy who's supposed to be a good acting
139032	34.892	59.558	-2.3333332538604736	4	 I don't think it's as good as those in space, you know movies, because I felt not only was the production really cheap, (umm) I I (stutter) just didn't really believe that you can have a whole spaceship full of people, never (umm) showing like you (stutter) no gravity scenes and that was, but that was not the majority of the problem though
139032	78.972	94.439	-0.6666666865348816	7	 I think what matters the most is the movie has a good plot, it has a feasible plot you know, it's got maybe like a message at the end that's not too cliche (umm) and the movie failed in every aspect in my opinion
139032	74.921	79.972	-2.0	6	 But you know what, doesn't matter all of those, it doesn't matter if movies look beautiful
139032	95.055	98.37	-2.0	9	 I didn't think the story was interesting
139032	93.439	96.025	-0.6666666865348816	8	 I didn't think it was visually stunning
13JpsLvddoY	42.754	47.027	2.0	8	Thanks again for your support, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.
13JpsLvddoY	23.259	29.227	1.6666666269302368	5	It was really great to interact with so many customers and meet a lot of new friendly faces.

140293	6.357	9.981	0.0	1	 And it's rated PG-thirteen
140293	0.0	6.858	0.0	0	I'm here to review this movie and it's called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
140293	24.067	32.45	1.0	3	 And (uhh) this (uhh) young woman here, she (uhh) comes out as a, you know another master fighter but she tries to hide it
140293	9.54	24.678	1.0	2	 And it's about (uhh) martial arts fighting and (uhh) believe it was really based in China and about (uhh) these two master fighers, and they're all their abilites and the storyline that goes with it's real interesting
140293	42.994	50.349	-1.6666666269302368	5	 But (uhh) it was (uhh) kind of strange and I didn't really understand (uhh) a lot about it but
140293	31.799	43.565	1.0	4	 But the stories the story's (stutter) okay and the (uhh) fight scenes, you know if you're really, if you're into martial arts and that kind of thing this is a good one, I mean it's really good choreographed fight scenes
140293	59.027	66.483	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) For me it was a little bit boring, and (umm) (uhh) but you might, you might (stutter) see something different in it, so
140293	50.078	59.748	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) If you enjoy the martial arts arts (stutter) and understand, you know a lot of the things that are behind the martial arts, this will be an interesting one for you to see but
140317	56.702	62.641	0.6666666865348816	11	 It's been out for a long time, but you can find it on DVD now, and (uhh) your prices will vary
140317	53.799	57.702	0.0	10	 So (uhh) it's been, it's an older movie, like I said
140317	61.641	67.57	-0.3333333432674408	12	 So (uhh) try it and (uhh) you may enjoy it, you know, more than I did
140317	3.513	6.818	0.0	1	 And it stars Kris Kristofferson
140317	0.0	3.995	0.3333333432674408	0	I'm here to review this movie called Millennium
140317	7.564	11.807	0.0	3	 It's been out for quite a while, but it's on (uhh) DVD now
140317	6.267	8.564	0.0	2	 And it's an older movie
140317	14.688	18.891	0.0	5	 And this is (uhh) about time travel
140317	11.346	15.159	-0.3333333432674408	4	 And (uhh) it's rated PG-thirteen
140317	26.032	37.688	0.0	7	 I don't want to mess up the story for you, but (uhh) it's interesting because, you know, it's about futuristic things and time travel, but (uhh) the story's kind of, kind of (stutter) nothing
140317	18.34	27.032	0.0	6	 And about (uhh) people way in the future that (uhh) come back to our time and different times and (uhh) the the (stutter) things that they do
140317	43.981	54.24	0.3333333432674408	9	 But if you like the idea of time travel and that kind of thing, you might enjoy this, because it gives you a little different idea about, you know, how things might be
140317	36.788	44.981	-1.6666666269302368	8	 You know? It's kind of boring and it's so far out there and (uhh) it's just kind, it's just really unbelievable
154449	58.937	62.132	-2.0	11	 I mean, it was pretty bad
154449	52.592	59.139	-2.6666667461395264	10	 I don't even know why they paid money to make this movie
154449	67.937	71.97	-0.3333333432674408	13	 So, anyway, that's my review of this movie
154449	61.132	67.969	-2.3333332538604736	12	 I like Queen Latifah and I like Jimmy Fallon, but they just don't do very well together, I guess
154449	0.8	2.458	0.3333333432674408	1	 My name is Kaitlyn
154449	0.0	0.632	0.0	0	Hi
154449	9.131	10.679	-0.3333333432674408	3	 Okay
154449	1.458	8.824	0.3333333432674408	2	 I'm doing a review on the movie Taxi with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon
154449	10.927	14.94	-2.0	5	 This movie was pretty bad
154449	9.999	11.927	-2.3333332538604736	4	 Two thumbs down
154449	25.883	37.319	-1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) Supposedly, USA Today says it's hilarious, real belly laughs, but, yeah, it was funny, but it was funny because it was so stupid
154449	16.095	24.029	-3.0	6	 (umm) Not only was it cheesy, but the storyline {sigh} was just dumb
154449	43.313	53.233	-3.0	9	 (umm) Maybe it was my husband's, but {sigh} I would not pay money to see this movie or buy this movie
154449	36.937	42.717	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) I don't even know why we own this video, to be honest with you
15837	53.699	55.507	0.3333333432674408	11	 Watch it with the guys
15837	51.075	54.19	2.3333332538604736	10	 But (uhh) yeah for me hilarious, funny
15837	55.485	57.952	2.0	13	 It's hilarious, good college film
15837	54.527	56.266	1.6666666269302368	12	 Watch it with anybody
15837	4.172	9.193	0.0	1	 It's (uhh) Jackass The Movie, Special Collectors Edition
15837	0.44	4.883	0.0	0	Alright, the film I'm reviewing right here is a Paramount (uhh) movie
15837	10.577	14.86	2.3333332538604736	3	 I think this is one of the funniest movies I've probably seen in a long time
15837	8.722	11.298	3.0	2	 This is a great movie
15837	22.74	24.707	2.3333332538604736	5	 It's really funny
15837	15.317	23.211	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) I dunno, it's a compilation of a whole bunch of stupid stunts by the MTV gang, Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, and all those guys
15837	32.009	40.791	1.3333333730697632	7	 I'd say it's really good, and you should see it only if you have a very like, you're not squeamish or anything like that, so yeah
15837	23.707	32.37	-2.0	6	 It's really stupid, so you have to have an open mind because there's a lot of male nudity and (uhh) just absolutely retarded stuff so
15837	42.475	51.626	0.6666666865348816	9	 This is R rated and (uhh) a lot lot of crazy stuff that your kids will try to do if you don't yeah so don't let them see this at all
15837	39.98	43.215	-1.0	8	 I put that warning out there, not for younger kids
15Wu4U2VPLw	1.278	8.594	0.0	1	In negotiation with police and other stakeholders, you can identify most evidence-based treatments to apply the crime problems
15Wu4U2VPLw	8.362	14.181	0.0	2	All stakeholders should then probably agree on the division of responsibilities for the entire project
15Wu4U2VPLw	30.662	39.294	0.0	5	The Victoria Police can support applications by providing a letter from the relevant local area commanders
15Wu4U2VPLw	21.822	30.963	0.0	4	And then, there's opportunity too, to do some research identifying effective treatments for similar crime problems in other areas or jurisdictions as well
15Wu4U2VPLw	42.934	46.328	0.3333333432674408	7	So, it's not just limited to your local area commanders
15Wu4U2VPLw	38.763	43.934	0.3333333432674408	6	You can even speak to your local crime prevention officers or other police as well
15Wu4U2VPLw	50.407	54.101	0.0	9	To supplement other evidence obtained by local councils
15Wu4U2VPLw	45.847	50.988	0.0	8	But just reiterating CCTV, it has to be a local area commander at a minimum

180923	70.96	76.759	-2.3333332538604736	11	 I found this film to be one of the worst Disney movies
180923	65.393	71.471	0.0	10	 Hercules is very trusting and even though Phil does not trust Meg, they don't know what's happening
180923	78.014	82.017	-1.6666666269302368	13	 It's very violent and it's not one that I would recommend
180923	75.759	79.014	-1.0	12	 It, I don't even know how it got a G rating
180923	81.566	86.427	-0.3333333432674408	14	 The only bonus feature on the DVD is the making of Hercules feature
180923	7.155	10.49	0.0	1	 Today I'd like to review the Disney DVD Hercules
180923	0.0	7.287	0.0	0	Hi, this is mom of three for Expo TV
180923	13.8	17.534	0.0	3	 It's rated G and it's ninety-three minutes long
180923	10.677	14.8	0.0	2	 This film was originally released in nineteen ninety seven
180923	24.585	26.394	0.0	5	 He never fit in
180923	17.182	25.326	0.0	4	 It follows the story of Hercules who has god parents, but he was raised on earth
180923	39.581	51.078	0.0	7	 He enlists the friend, the help of his friend (umm) Pegasus, (stutter) his friend Phil, rather, to help him do this
180923	25.394	39.604	-0.3333333432674408	6	 He has this abnormal amount of strength and he doesn't know where it comes from and he finally finds out that his dad is Zeus, but he has to be do a true heroic act before he can go and live with the gods in a temple
180923	59.147	65.076	0.0	9	 He uses Meg to try to get him derailed from his mission
180923	50.337	60.147	0.0	8	 But all this time, there is a villain of the the name of Hades, who's trying to come along and make it so he can't do his heroic deed
184784	4.102	8.664	0.3333333432674408	1	 (umm) I really liked the original Weekend at Bernie's so I thought I would like this one
184784	0.0	4.005	0.0	0	Today I'm doing a review for Weekend at Bernie's Two
184784	27.03	32.57	0.3333333432674408	3	 So they have to go back to the Virgin Islands and, and find the money
184784	8.452	27.78	0.3333333432674408	2	 Basically after the first movie ends and they spend their weekend with Bernie (umm) these two guys (uhh) go to their bank and find out they're fired (umm) and they also find out that Bernie, when he was alive, had stolen two million dollars and it's in the Virgin Islands
184784	36.449	43.395	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) It's it's (stutter) just not as funny as the first one, I like, I liked the first one a lot better
184784	32.478	35.822	0.0	4	 (umm) This is the movie playing in the background
184784	42.724	53.043	-0.6666666865348816	6	 In this movie there's this, you know, in the Virgin Islands there's this lady who brings them back to life and, I don't know, I just thought that was kind of lame
186631	73.983	90.588	2.0	11	 So as they would have it, he ends up in a store in France, and from there there's some hilarious wonderful authentic and funny, funny stuff that is just so right on with food network and the way cooking should be
186631	64.605	74.494	-0.6666666865348816	10	 His family is appalled because he, he (stutter) wants to be a chef because they can't seem to figure out why he just doesn't want to sniff garbage
186631	90.057	104.586	3.0	12	 It's just a wonderful movie for all ages, so if you want to see something that's very entertaining with a lot of laughs and even get educated about how to cook, with a (uhh) profession such as a gourmet chef from France, you'll love Remy
186631	2.226	6.878	1.0	1	 I have to tell you about a movie that was fantastic
186631	0.64	3.127	0.0	0	Hello expo my name is Jocelyn
186631	11.745	16.087	2.3333332538604736	3	 This movie is so good because it's very real
186631	6.327	11.637	1.0	2	 It's Ratatouille and it was really a great animated movie
186631	29.335	32.979	2.0	5	 That is what is one of the things that makes it so great
186631	15.606	29.626	0.3333333432674408	4	 The reason it's real is because the animators were actually asked to go to France and film everything culinary, just the way it would be cooked so that it could be reproduced in this movie
186631	45.598	50.339	1.3333333730697632	7	 That really translates so there has to be some great animators to do that
186631	33.036	46.139	1.3333333730697632	6	 Remy is played by Patton Oswalt and he does a fantastic job of you can even see the expressions of Remy, but and that's quite odd, even when he's running or when he's thinking about what he's cooking
186631	57.8	65.126	0.0	9	 He wants to be a chef although and, since he's a rat that sort of holds him back because society frowns on that
186631	49.888	58.082	0.0	8	 One prepares the food, it's just as it is, was (stutter) or is to be prepared, the way that the culinary chefs do to prepare food
188122	60.554	64.826	1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) Haven't seen him around for a while so he's very, funny too
188122	57.132	60.566	0.0	10	 (umm) (umm) And also stars (umm) Bob Newhart
188122	71.529	74.474	0.0	13	 He's on the track to find his father
188122	64.894	72.05	0.0	12	 (umm) The whole movie is a Christmas theme about an elf who (umm) learns that he's human
188122	83.402	86.776	0.0	15	 (umm) I think (umm) this movie is (umm) (umm) PG
188122	74.133	83.215	1.3333333730697632	14	 (umm) And then he also (umm) is gonna teach some people about (umm) spreading (stutter) Christmas cheer all around the year and what the true meaning of Christmas is
188122	87.991	100.415	2.0	16	 And it is (umm) ninety-five minutes long, so it's not a very long movie but even though it is a Christmas I suggest you watch it any time of the year
188122	5.798	13.034	-1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm) Honestly right up front I'll tell you that I'm not a person that likes to watch a seasonal movies out of season
188122	0.0	4.503	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hello my name's Karen and I'm gonna review for you the movie Elf

188122	12.872	15.618	0.0	2	 (umm) Elf being a Christmas movie
188122	20.545	24.478	2.0	5	 (umm) I really enjoy watching Will Ferrell in this movie
188122	18.599	20.766	0.0	4	 (umm) It stars Will Ferrell
188122	25.543	37.618	0.0	7	 And he has (umm) (umm) slipped into Santa's bag in an orphanage so he's raised raised (stutter) in (umm) the North Pole as an elf
188122	24.156	25.955	0.0	6	 (umm) He plays elf
188122	47.384	53.552	1.3333333730697632	9	 (umm) It's funny as usual (umm) Will Ferrel's just (umm) out of the box on this one
188122	38.823	47.206	0.0	8	 (umm) He finds out that he was adopted, he is human and this (umm) takes him on a journey to meet his father
189966	104.723	109.654	0.0	24	 And it is with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix
189966	108.654	110.852	-2.0	25	 One out of five stars
189966	97.041	101.174	-1.0	20	 If you want to watch something like this, you go on with your bad self
189966	100.174	102.541	-2.0	21	 I do not like the film
189966	102.059	104.616	-2.0	22	 And I will not watch it again
189966	103.646	105.534	0.0	23	 It's rated R
189966	1.638	6.229	-1.6666666269302368	1	 Today I'm reviewing for you a movie that I truly dislike
189966	0.291	2.488	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey, Summer here for ExpoTV
189966	10.677	19.23	0.0	3	 Now, the basic premise behind this movie is Nicolas Cage is a cop, and he's trying his best to find out what happened with a six-year-old crime
189966	5.728	10.949	0.0	2	 The movie is eight millimeters with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix
189966	21.792	31.981	-0.3333333432674408	5	 And in the process, he finds (umm) an integrated trail of mystery, murder, thrillers
189966	18.599	22.163	0.0	4	 So he is reinvestigating an old crime
189966	35.69	39.823	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) I did not like the storyline of the movie, first of all
189966	31.051	35.683	0.0	6	 And all of it is being captured on eight millimeter film
189966	48.92	53.003	0.0	9	 It, it (stutter) was on film, and then (stutter) they showed you clips of these films
189966	39.412	49.92	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) I I (stutter) liked even less the fact that there was actually on film violence, rape, and murder
189966	54.108	59.329	0.6666666865348816	11	 I mean, there can be, I've watched many, many psychological thrillers that were really, really good
189966	52.003	55.108	-1.6666666269302368	10	 And I I (stutter) wasn't, you know, thrilled with that
189966	60.175	66.792	-1.6666666269302368	13	 I understand that the basis of the movie is the eight millimeter film basis, but it could have been done in a different way
189966	58.738	61.175	0.0	12	 And they didn't need to show this
189966	72.666	77.547	0.0	15	 And (uhh) Joel Schumacher, he he (stutter) was the one that directed this movie
189966	66.121	73.287	0.0	14	 I mean, the the (stutter) people that were involved in this movie were the writer that wrote this was the same writer that wrote Seven
189966	84.539	86.916	-2.0	17	 So I didn't like eight millimeter

18QjfdhJEM4	185.381	197.025	-2.0	20	The founding fathers had strong feelings about taxation without representation and under no circumstances would they have felt excluding 98% of Congress from fiscal decisions was appropriate.
18QjfdhJEM4	135.634	146.32	0.0	14	The probable outcome is that any cuts realized will be more a function of lobbying prowess than the merits or demerits of the actual programs on the chopping block.

190740	37.616	46.558	-2.6666667461395264	7	 The movie from beginning to end does not even begin to employ the scariness of the video game and I know that's what they were trying for
190740	31.001	37.937	-2.6666667461395264	6	 This is the least scary movie I have ever watched in my entire life

192799	61.162	67.141	-2.3333332538604736	12	 Suddenly when Robin Williams takes over in the movie it's just like wow, he's not boring, he's not funny like they are

192799	31.809	37.498	-2.0	6	 (uhh) I found myself just losing complete interest halfway through the movie
192799	46.585	52.055	-2.3333332538604736	9	 (uhh) Even the part where he's running for president is not funny, it's just, there's hardly any jokes
192799	39.272	46.857	-2.3333332538604736	8	 He gets elected and then suddenly he goes from a comedian to a real politician and it gets real, it just gets boring it's not funny
193291	39.242	63.4	-1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm) Unfortunately I didn't think that this was the funniest movie, so I guess what it really comes down to is this movie is sort of like it takes stand up comedian's doing their act you put it into a movie and ya throw in some separate parts where their you know you're going into sidelines of of (stutter) what's going on and that's kind of what this movies about
193291	0.65	38.337	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hi this is a review for the movie Blue Collar Comedy Tour, it's playing behind me and actually what this movie is about is you have (umm) the four stars of the movie and that's Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy, and it's actually a movie about their comedy shows (umm) and with little bits and pieces mixed in it's like their stand up routines and than some ins and out's between it

194625	62.499	68.498	0.3333333432674408	13	 There's a few people on there who was, I thought was a bit ham handed with their acting
194625	58.927	63.499	1.0	12	 The acting is for the most part pretty good
194625	76.268	87.445	-2.0	15	" It's one of those ""oh, okay, I'm done with this"" type of movie and (umm) so I really wish I had (uhh) maybe previewed it, or someone had given me an honest review of it"
194625	70.212	76.5	-2.0	14	 (umm) I really can't recommend anybody buying this film because it's not something you want to watch over
194625	92.391	94.629	-1.6666666269302368	17	 Honestly it was boring
194625	86.834	92.384	-1.6666666269302368	16	 Cause I just found it (umm) boring
194625	94.327	109.215	-2.0	18	 (umm) and I'm a fan of British mysteries, a big fan of British mysteries and of British (umm) {noise} in the countryside type of shows so I was very unhappy with how bad this one turned out to be

194625	25.114	28.09	-2.3333332538604736	6	 (umm) I am not a fan of it
194625	51.814	54.849	-1.0	9	 I thought it was kind a heavy handed storytelling
194625	36.399	52.814	-2.6666667461395264	8	 (umm) I found a lot of the acting to be quite pretentious and it was (uhh) supposed to be a mystery and I pretty much figured out who was gonna die and who did it (umm) well before the movie (stutter) was even halfway through
197778	80.089	86.617	3.0	11	 And (umm) we just love it, it's a great story and there's Aladar when he's just a baby
197778	66.39	81.089	0.0	10	 They go through many many different adventures and trials including (umm) a comet that comes and hits the Earth and their home island is destroyed but they end up moving to another one

19k6sEC7814	13.381	21.555	0.6666666865348816	1	Both in the practice of international affairs and and in the more academic research that's related to many of these areas.
19k6sEC7814	0.0	14.022	0.6666666865348816	0	As the world has become more integrated economically and the relationship between economics and politics has become tighter and tighter and more interesting over time, I think this has been one of the really interesting growth areas.
19k6sEC7814	20.684	30.694	0.6666666865348816	2	Well the big questions that we confront in our everyday life are those that really reflect the challenges that our government faces and it works with a lot of other parties.

1A-aRhYx-GQ	139.983	146.391	2.3333332538604736	24	I feel much more confident and generally  I'm just doing a lot of things now that I never thought I could do.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	62.24	66.971	1.0	11	and I did some research online and I found the jump manual.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	69.424	73.497	1.0	13	I knew that this gonna be the program that would take me to the next level.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	151.268	155.5	0.6666666865348816	27	and without the jump manual I wouldn't be able to do any of these things.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	78.194	88.672	0.6666666865348816	15	and I didn't measure my vertical before I started using the jump manual but I’m using the rim on the basket as a gauge to how high I’m jumping and how much I’m improving.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	73.355	78.924	1.0	14	About the program... when I started the program immediately I noticed gains in my vertical.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	95.045	100.645	0.6666666865348816	17	And then, as I started using the jump manual I gradually added inches and improving.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	109.991	117.107	1.6666666269302368	19	I can now jump off Two feet and dunk with One hand, I can also jump off Two feet and dunk with Two hands.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	181.2	188.934	1.3333333730697632	32	So if you're still thinking on whether to buy the jump manual or another product that you're looking, don't look any further.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	174.834	181.741	2.0	31	but I think what you'll get in return is  pricless in terms of what it’s worth.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	188.064	200.368	2.3333332538604736	33	get the jump manual, I’ve included a link for you in here in the bottom, start working on it and you'll amazed at how great of a program it really is.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	65.971	70.064	1.3333333730697632	12	and I knew right away that this was going to be the program for me.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	19.657	30.624	1.0	5	I could reach the backboard jumping off of One foot with Two hands and I could also touch the rim when jumping off of One foot with One hand but still, I was nowhere close to dunking.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	12.563	20.657	-0.3333333432674408	4	Before I discovered the jump manual and started using the jump manual workouts I was pretty much an average jumper.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	35.551	42.288	0.6666666865348816	7	I wanted to be a jumper that people would want to gather around in the gym and watch him dunk.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	47.104	62.023	-0.3333333432674408	9	So I started doing some research because I just wasn't happy with where I was and I knew that I had to do some research to find a program or to find something that could really help me improve my vertical so that I’ll be able to dunk.
1A-aRhYx-GQ	116.107	121.458	0.0	20	I can stand underneath the basket flatfooted and jump up and dunk with both hands.

1k7br8xXMSU	103.975	121.039	-0.3333333432674408	12	This is really beneficial because it also shows me what products are selling, so for instance I want to put in a small order with a vendor, I can try a new product, if I see that customers are responding well to it, it's already paid for so by the time I have to pay the vendor off, and that allows me to buy more of it.

202810	71.17	77.597	-0.3333333432674408	11	 It's it's (stutter) They're all good in their individual ways and yet it doesn't add up to much

202810	77.805	82.077	-1.3333333730697632	12	 And I think that's the problem this movie, it doesn't really leave you with anything
202810	4.531	7.517	-1.6666666269302368	1	 It's not that great or that wonderful, actually

202810	7.135	12.545	0.6666666865348816	2	 The thing about The Great New Wonderful is it's an independent movie, but independent movies that's been around for a while
202810	28.347	37.748	-1.0	5	 (umm) I think some of the story some of the (stutter) storylines are tired out, there's there's (stutter) a psychiatrist who's driving his patient crazy you know, by analyzing him too much
202810	15.915	28.519	-1.3333333730697632	4	 There's not a lot of substance to this movie it's just sort of following a trail of people that are sort of distantly connected to each other through other characters in the movie and there's not a lot of payoff at the end
202810	53.51	56.805	-1.3333333730697632	7	 Yeah life is chaos, life is boring we know that
202810	36.848	54.051	-1.6666666269302368	6	 I mean we never we never (stutter) heard that joke before and (umm) there's just strange things that don't seem to really mean anything or make any sense, and I think we've moved past that, especially independent film needs to have more to it than just, oh look at all this chaos
202810	60.444	69.127	0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) You've got you've got (stutter) a great cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Tony Shalhoub, Edie Falco from the Sopranos, Stephen Colbert, obviously the Colbert Report
202810	55.964	60.466	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It needs to be something some art to it, and there's not a lot of art to this movie I don't think

202990	73.015	82.985	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (umm) This movie, I don't know, I I (stutter) kinda I I (stutter) started to zone out because the movie seemed like it lasted so long
202990	88.191	92.015	-0.3333333432674408	13	 Honestly when you're in the theater it's going to seem like about six to eight
202990	85.846	88.762	0.0	12	 It said it's two and a half hours long
202990	93.309	108.916	-2.6666667461395264	15	" It's like it drags on and it's one of those movies where you really have to be thinking the whole time, so when all you're thinking about is ""god when is this gonna end?"" it's hard to concentrate on the movie, which is why I got really confused towards the middle and the end"
202990	91.583	93.87	-1.6666666269302368	14	 The movie never ends
202990	108.704	112.698	-1.0	16	 Started off okay but I think the movie got progressively worse
202990	8.183	23.331	-0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) I'd like to state that this is Michael Clayton who is the fixer of (uhh) court cases and not Michael Clayton the wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
202990	0.331	7.876	0.0	0	Today what I'd like to review is the movie Michael Clayton starring George Clooney as Michael Clayton
202990	29.923	35.124	-2.3333332538604736	3	 This movie I did not enjoy whatsoever
202990	23.428	30.095	-1.3333333730697632	2	 You go into it thinking it's a football movie (uhh) you're definitely going to be in for a little surprise
202990	36.878	47.585	-1.6666666269302368	5	 It was like a courtroom, a courtroom drama type movie which I definitely would not recommend, but that's just my taste, you might enjoy it
202990	34.653	37.878	-2.3333332538604736	4	 It was extremely long and boring to me
202990	58.638	62.132	0.0	7	 And he's got some family problems
202990	47.922	59.638	0.0	6	 So basically the story is about this guy named Michael Clayton who is a fixer and I wouldn't really say that he enjoys his job but I definitely think he's good at it
202990	64.475	70.523	-0.3333333432674408	9	 He's not doing so hot (uhh) cash wise in the beginning
202990	62.439	64.407	0.0	8	 (uhh) He's divorced
206049	4.95	14.311	-2.3333332538604736	1	 I have to say even though I knew I was going to hate it, I was not proven wrong I mean it was a really horrible movie
206049	0.0	5.95	1.0	0	Hi expo TV this is Vasili and I am going to be reviewing Fred Claus
206049	44.311	53.931	-2.0	3	 I though she does a lot better films than this sort of one and even though it's a horrible, holiday film I maybe this could be good but no it was bad
206049	13.85	45.311	0.3333333432674408	2	 Vince Vaughn plays Santa Claus' Nicolas Claus' brother the quote on quote black sheep of the family and apparently due to some saint mythology the family and spouses of a saint do not ever die or grow old so Vince Vaughn is preserved even as it's hundred of years later he appears to be the same age and he's dating Rachel Weisz who I have no idea why she was even in the film
206049	52.931	61.564	-1.3333333730697632	4	 The jokes weren't funny, they were really cliche, you know a lot of elf jokes and anyway I just don't recommend it
206051	41.427	45.47	-1.0	11	 And Dustin Hoffman with a lisp, you know, is not a pretty sight
206051	39.921	42.427	-0.6666666865348816	10	 I don't know why she did this movie
206051	50.257	53.542	-1.6666666269302368	13	 And I think everyone will be really, really bored
206051	44.47	51.187	-2.3333332538604736	12	 So I don't think this movie was good for kids or adults
206051	57.231	60.935	-2.6666667461395264	15	 It was the worst movie I think I've ever seen in my whole life
206051	52.542	58.231	-3.0	14	 So, unfortunately, I have to give it a zero out of ten
206051	0.211	6.21	0.3333333432674408	1	 This is Vasily, and I am going to be reviewing Mr

206051	13.201	15.977	-0.3333333432674408	4	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium will be better
206051	22.929	30.644	-1.6666666269302368	7	 You know? I think it was trying to emulate Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but it really just didn't make sense
206051	20.185	23.46	-1.6666666269302368	6	 I have no idea what that movie was about
206051	36.738	40.921	0.3333333432674408	9	 And, you know, Natalie Portman, I like her usually
206051	29.644	37.738	-2.0	8	 It was just a very imaginative, very boring movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman
206376	6.058	11.587	0.0	1	 This was the movie Fred Claus, starring Vince Vaughn
206376	0.46	6.359	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi Expo TV, I'd like to review a movie currently in theaters that I saw

206376	12.204	16.067	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) This is pretty much your typical holiday movie
206376	28.566	33.677	-0.3333333432674408	5	 I wouldn't expect much more I mean, it's Christmas time
206376	20.774	29.177	-2.0	4	 It's gonna be some cheap laughs (uhh) crummy plot and that's about it
206376	35.471	39.783	-1.0	7	 Kind of disappointing that Vince Vaughn is in it cause I thought he was funnier than that
206376	32.677	35.633	0.0	6	 They have to come out with these movies it seems like
206376	48.272	68.578	0.0	9	 (uhh) As you may or may not know the plot is of Santa Claus' brother (umm) is also privileged to live forever like Santa and that's pretty much all you need to know
206376	38.873	47.546	-1.6666666269302368	8	 But if you can get over the fact that it is a crappy holiday movie, you might actually enjoy it sort of
206507	72.586	80.191	-1.0	11	 I don't recommend it for people and the actors on this movie, they didn't really do a good job either
206507	69.902	73.586	-2.0	10	 I just again, really just did not like this movie
206507	81.875	88.413	-1.6666666269302368	13	 These you know, girls that played in this movie just they didn't really do a good job
206507	79.191	82.875	-0.3333333432674408	12	 It was you know, kind of expected as well
206507	8.482	13.024	-1.6666666269302368	1	 (uhh) Basically, I really did not like this movie at all
206507	0.62	7.127	0.0	0	Hello, my name is Sarah, and I will be doing the video review for the movie Josie and the Pussycats
206507	16.703	23.321	-1.0	3	 (umm) Of course I had low expectations at that, and hose expectations weren't even met
206507	13.241	16.785	-1.3333333730697632	2	 (umm) I felt it was kinda cheesy
206507	27.19	43.774	0.6666666865348816	5	 (umm) I, I (stutter) found one thing about this movie that I thought was kind of interesting how (umm) these record companies put (uhh) subliminal messages in music to push products to get people to buy certain things
206507	22.41	27.022	-1.6666666269302368	4	 So you know, to recommend this movie, you know I really wouldn't
206507	51.714	56.116	-0.6666666865348816	7	 You know (umm) it was actually expected to be kind of corny
206507	43.692	52.285	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) That part of the movie was pretty cool, but (umm) for the most part you know, it was, again it was too cheesy for me
206507	61.162	70.364	-0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) No, I mean, basically the movie was just you know, trying to put you know, just
206507	55.515	60.366	-1.6666666269302368	8	 So I really wouldn't recommend this, this (stutter) movie to anybody
206606	71.609	75.921	-1.3333333730697632	10	 But to me that wasn't enough to make a great film
206606	8.342	20.148	0.0	1	 It's a fullscreen edition (uhh) which means you get some special features including two documentaries, the many faces of Catwoman, profiles the (stutter) evolution of the character
206606	1.268	8.085	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi my name is Will and this is my video opinion of the movie Catwoman starring Halle Berry
206606	25.454	29.028	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) I thought that Catwoman was horrible
206606	20.146	25.526	1.0	2	 (umm) You get an exciting alternative ending in the (stutter) additional scenes as well
206606	41.986	46.478	-1.0	5	 I thought that it was (uhh) it relied too, too (stutter) much on the CGI
206606	28.786	42.836	-2.0	4	 (uhh) Quite honestly I thought that the big budget you know, film, it should have, the, you know, computer generated images should have worked more seamlessly with the stunts and things like that
206606	52.562	61.554	-1.3333333730697632	7	 I thought you know it, you know while it did stay true to its origin, it's just when she did come back I thought her powers were a little unreal for me
206606	46.326	53.153	-2.0	6	 I didn't (umm) you know, I didn't really like the way that they made her come back to life
206606	65.363	72.539	1.0	9	 Her costume of course was great that was one of the highlights having Halle Berry in the movie, you know getting some eye candy
206606	61.881	65.874	-2.0	8	 (umm) I just you know, just didn't really enjoy it
207812	9.879	18.132	1.6666666269302368	1	 It's got (uhh) Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez and it's a really good movie
207812	0.231	10.28	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey Expo Tv, this is Victor and I have for you a review on this movie entitled Crazy Beautiful
207812	34.702	41.14	2.3333332538604736	3	 (umm) And and (stutter) it also features one of my all time favorite bands Oskar, in the movie
207812	17.312	33.767	1.3333333730697632	2	 It's (umm) primarily targeted towards like the teenager kind of audience, but the cool thing about this movie is that it has a really cool soundtrack
207812	43.293	49.202	1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) But, it's a really cool movie because it's very it's very (stutter) real, you know
207812	40.479	42.886	2.6666667461395264	4	 So I thought that was really cool
207812	61.621	77.577	2.0	7	 It's got you know, a lot of real kind of stuff you know? I I (stutter) definitely relate to it and so (umm) Chicago Tribune gave it three stars, but I'm giving it five stars
207812	48.202	62.053	1.0	6	 You can tell (umm) I mean, (stutters) you really start to believe in these characters, that they're going through these (uhh) experiences and stuff and I know that a lot of teenagers in high school can relate to this
207812	80.967	83.244	-0.6666666865348816	9	 I know it's kind of cheesy but
207812	77.864	81.588	1.3333333730697632	8	 It's just I, I, I (stutter) enjoyed the movie I'm not gonna lie
208148	89.767	94.569	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (umm) You know I was kind of hoping for a little more excitement like the first one
208148	81.536	89.42	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (umm) I mean I, that (stutter), you know again to me it it (stutter) was kind of boring, it just you know, didn't really enthuse me at all
208148	4.501	11.897	-2.0	1	 (uhh) It's the sequel to the first one, (umm) basically I really did not like this movie at all
208148	0.0	4.912	0.0	0	My name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the movie Bring It on Again
208148	18.1	29.237	-2.3333332538604736	3	 (umm) I think it was kind of corny, you know I mean some of the the (stutter) jokes in here were just outrageously you know dumb for me
208148	11.944	17.763	-1.0	2	 (umm) I you know it was of course expected being that it was a straight to dvd movie
208148	38.524	42.547	-1.6666666269302368	5	 But you know, I, it was not my favorite at all
208148	29.634	39.524	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) It, you know I mean I guess basically if you like cheerleading and you know, it's something that you do yourself, pick up the movie
208148	54.507	60.087	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) And basically they didn't like how things were going so they decided to start their own cheer team
208148	41.587	54.121	0.0	6	 It was basically about (umm) two girls going to college and joining (umm) one of the you know, great qualifying (uhh) cheer teams in the country
208148	67.707	80.72	0.0	9	 So they go through different things of you know, trying to start their own team (umm) you know, doing their own routines, pretty much starting from scratch where the first form routine had already been there
208148	59.736	68.707	0.0	8	 And you know, then there was a competition that they had to compete for that school because that you know, school could only have one cheer team it couldn't have two
208299	74.921	81.558	-2.3333332538604736	10	 (uhh) There was hardly any suspense, and just overall (uhh) not a good film {noise} so
208299	11.874	19.469	-2.0	1	 (umm) My wife and I saw it (uhh) believe it was two weeks ago, and (uhh) it was pretty terrible
208299	0.0	12.076	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, my name is Mike and I'm here to do a movie review for Thirty Days of Night, which is a moderately new (uhh) film that's still in theaters and it stars Josh Hartnett
208299	21.552	29.237	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh) The main reason behind it was (uhh) there just really wasn't a lot of action, the colors were pretty drab
208299	18.579	22.014	-3.0	2	 It was not a good film, (uhh) whatsoever
208299	40.569	53.492	-1.6666666269302368	5	 And they really didn't do a lot with the (uhh) with the new slant on everything that they were going for, which was having the vampires be (uhh) the bad guys in this (uhh) horror movie
208299	29.005	41.539	-1.0	4	 (uhh) Even though it was set in Alaska during a period (uhh) in which you get constant night, (umm) everything just seemed to not flow really well, the plot was kind of boring
208299	62.998	68.817	-2.0	7	 Halfway through the film, (uhh) (uhh) quite a few people left because they were pretty bored
208299	53.54	63.589	-2.3333332538604736	6	 (umm) Just overall the flow was awful, (uhh) the audience seemed to not enjoy really anything as well as if (uhh) me or my wife didn't enjoy anything
208299	71.1	75.163	-2.6666667461395264	9	 The acting was pretty stiff and stilted
208299	68.226	72.1	-1.3333333730697632	8	 And (uhh) just overall it wasn't really enjoyable
208416	73.195	81.498	1.6666666269302368	11	 It's a little bit long but there's a lot action and it will really just draw you in and the time will go by quickly
208416	70.771	74.195	3.0	10	 But this is definitely a movie that you can enjoy
208416	86.325	88.772	1.6666666269302368	13	 And it's overall just a good movie
208416	81.067	86.966	1.3333333730697632	12	 The DVD of course has deleted scenes and the director's commentary, always fun to see these things
208416	89.508	91.865	2.0	15	 Definitely fun to watch
208416	87.772	90.099	2.6666667461395264	14	 I'd give it five stars
208416	91.274	94.399	2.0	16	 Enjoyable and a escape from reality
208416	1.249	4.783	0.0	1	 This is Jennifer, and today I'm reviewing Gladiator
208416	0.0	2.119	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey Expo
208416	8.722	16.416	2.3333332538604736	3	 And the man is played by Russell Crowe who is just very macho in this movie and does an excellent job playing the role
208416	4.332	9.722	1.0	2	 This is an epic movie about a man who was a general in an army
208416	25.463	32.081	0.0	5	 So he goes about to exact his revenge and instead is captured and becomes a slave
208416	15.845	25.705	0.0	4	 He is a general in the army and he comes home and he finds that his village has been destroyed, his home has been destroyed, and his wife and chilled, child (stutter) killed
208416	47.643	58.062	1.6666666269302368	7	 Russell Crowe excels in this role and it just makes you want to stand up and cheer for him when you're watching this and you see what he goes through and what he overcomes
208416	31.659	47.915	0.3333333432674408	6	 He is forced to become a gladiator for the empire, and this is a movie about personal triumph and even though your body can be captured by someone, your spirit adheres and that it's how, it's how (stutter) you choose to live your life no matter what your circumstances are
208416	68.655	71.771	0.0	9	 I don't want to give it away in case you haven't seen it
208416	57.65	69.635	0.0	8	 In the back, in the sub ground there are different scenarios that are playing out with the king and his sister and things that are going on there to watch
209354	69.863	72.329	2.3333332538604736	11	 Pick it up as soon as you can
209354	67.628	70.673	2.0	10	 It's all good, everything's good in this movie
209354	4.661	13.363	2.0	1	 This is the widescreen special edition, I find it to be very entertaining in widescreen, much less than the full screen actually
209354	0.77	5.322	0.3333333432674408	0	What's up Expo, this is Adam here again and I'm reviewing Underworld
209354	23.967	43.395	0.0	3	 They're fighting each other for wars on end and then this movie, they, the main plot is about a, (uhh) is about a guy who is a descendant of one of these great, great (stutter) ancestors and he hold the key to a more higher power within his blood
209354	12.882	24.598	1.0	2	 But a little bit about this movie, it has retaken the idea of vampires and werewolves and they have them pitted against each other in a more, in a (stutter) mortal battle
209354	47.563	52.135	3.0	5	 But Underworld it's definitely gonna get five out of five stars
209354	42.425	48.563	0.0	4	 So a little bit about that is just the, I mean I'm not gonna reveal too much about the movie
209354	55.555	58.59	0.3333333432674408	7	 Everyone's got their own little spinoff
209354	51.135	56.555	2.3333332538604736	6	 This movie is full of action, intensity, I really like what they do with the vampires and the werewolves
209354	61.99	68.548	2.6666667461395264	9	 So Underworld, give it five out of five stars, look for the sequel Underworld Evolution
209354	57.62	62.541	1.3333333730697632	8	 This one, this one (stutter) has a good spinoff of them so you're not gonna be disappointed by that
209775	64.385	71.461	-2.3333332538604736	10	 So I give this a half a star out of five, and again I think the Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York
209775	5.579	11.687	-1.0	1	 Academy Award for best picture winner of two-thousand and two which it definitely should not have won
209775	2.316	6.06	0.3333333432674408	0	Alright so next up we've got Chicago
209775	23.668	30.145	1.6666666269302368	3	 (uhh) I like (uhh) I think the performers are good performers, Richard Gere and (uhh) Catherine Zeta Jones and Rene Zellweger
209775	10.687	24.268	-2.3333332538604736	2	 The Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York, (uhh) Scorsese's masterpiece, or one of his masterpieces I think with (uhh) some other great movies, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas which I think a lot of people love more, but Chicago I thought was a terrible movie
209775	35.481	43.315	-2.3333332538604736	5	 To me this was like a made for TV (stutter) movie, they were trying too hard to try and reinvent the Hollywood musical and it just fell flat
209775	29.145	36.221	-1.0	4	 I find the ladies very attractive (uhh) and very talented actresses, I just didn't like them very much in this
209775	49.569	55.917	-2.3333332538604736	7	 I thought that (uhh), you know, (umm) it's just overdone, dumb, silly, ridiculous
209775	42.315	49.86	-2.0	6	 I think the choreography a lot of very hard work went into it, but as a piece of entertainment I personally did not enjoy it
209775	59.496	64.956	-1.3333333730697632	9	 I thought the story line was a little too (uhh) too (uhh) too much
209775	54.917	60.037	-2.3333332538604736	8	 I thought the lighting was unbelievable, I thought the style was (uhh) hokey and contrived
210238	56.493	59.259	-2.0	11	 It just, it just (stutter) wasn't good nothing worked
210238	53.49	57.493	-2.6666667461395264	10	 I found this movie absolutely dumb
210238	61.502	64.268	0.0	13	 (umm) The movie's rated PG-thirteen
210238	59.097	61.913	-0.3333333432674408	12	 (umm) These aren't my three favorite comedians
210238	77.036	85.12	-2.3333332538604736	15	 (umm) And also costars Danny Trejo, (umm) but that's about it I mean I don't wanna give away too much but I had a hard time sitting through this
210238	64.116	77.468	0.0	14	 (umm) It's eighty minutes eighty-nine (stutter) minutes long and it was it was (stutter) (umm) filmed in two thousand seven it was completed and released, so that tells you a lot about how, how (stutter) good this movies I remember when it came out at the movie theaters it wasn't a hit at all
210238	93.13	98.031	-2.0	17	 (umm) But if you're thinking about buying this movie I probably think twice again
210238	84.12	92.922	-1.3333333730697632	16	 I (stutter) just, I didn't find it funny I actually found it really stupid and as you can see in the background it's just a menu with some small clips from the movie
210238	97.36	100.066	0.3333333432674408	18	 So again this is for Delta Farce
210238	5.299	6.668	0.3333333432674408	1	 Thank you

21137	19.936	36.431	2.3333332538604736	5	 (umm), It's mostly about this guy named Borat who is a Kazaky reporter in America, and he's trying to learn about the culture and stuff here, and because he's so different he ends up making a fool out of himself and it's hilarious
21137	15.067	19.479	2.6666667461395264	4	 I loved it, and I laughed my butt off while I watched it
21137	48.671	54.33	2.0	7	 Of course it's all a big joke, but, it's hilarious to see him
21137	36.01	48.922	1.0	6	 (umm), It's kind of in a, mock documentary kind of style reality show kind of style where they follow him around with their cameras, and you see the wonderful interactions he has with Americans
21137	61.691	65.994	2.0	9	 So, I definitely recommend you going and seeing Borat the movie
21137	53.999	62.182	1.0	8	 And he goes to like different places, and (uhh), and (uhh), country rodeos in the south and things like that
212532	52.562	57.283	-2.0	10	 I don't know, I just, I really didn't enjoy this movie, I thought it was dumb
212532	1.249	4.015	0.3333333432674408	1	 This is a review of Good Luck Chuck
212532	0.0	2.249	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
212532	8.193	12.196	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) And it's a good thing I did because it's not a very good movie
212532	3.144	7.646	0.0	2	 I managed to catch this at the dollar theater at my local place
212532	26.351	29.566	-2.0	5	 Or or (stutter) something, it's it's (stutter) kind of ridiculous
212532	12.174	27.052	0.0	4	 (uhh) Basically it's about a guy who gets cursed when he's a kid by a goth girl and now every girl he meets and gets with (umm) will marry the next man that, that (stutter) (uhh) that she meets
212532	38.015	43.545	-1.0	7	 And (umm), you know, she's beautiful and everything but this is, it's (stutter) just stupid
212532	28.566	38.197	-1.3333333730697632	6	 It's got Dane Cook as the main guy, Charlie, it's got Dan Fogler as Stu, it's got Jessica Alba as (uhh) the love interest Cam
212532	48.272	53.562	-2.6666667461395264	9	 (umm) Not really that funny, kind of stupid, (umm) acting's not that great
212532	42.545	48.523	-2.0	8	 She's just running into stuff the whole time and it's just, it's ridiculous
213619	72.666	77.428	1.0	11	 But check it out, it's called Hostel part one, because there is a part two now
213619	64.984	73.237	-0.3333333432674408	10	 So you should see if they survive, if they die if they bleed to death, if they get their heads chopped off, limbs chopped off, if you're into that stuff
213619	2.625	7.995	0.6666666865348816	1	 I have the scariest movie in a decade
213619	0.969	3.625	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hey there, ExpoTV there
213619	9.24	11.118	0.0	3	 It's unrated
213619	6.995	9.243	0.0	2	 It's called Hostel
213619	21.333	26.863	0.6666666865348816	5	 (uhh) It's presented by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Eli Roth
213619	12.064	20.587	-2.0	4	 (uhh) But if it was rated it would be rated R because it's really bad for you and bad for the kids and there's a lot of killings and a lot of blood and a lot of gore
213619	33.665	43.784	0.3333333432674408	7	 (uhh) This movie first starts off as like a x rated because you see a lot of girls who has and a lot of guys ding dongs
213619	26.521	32.36	-1.3333333730697632	6	 So if you know them they have sick minds and they like to make sick movies
213619	47.394	65.515	0.0	9	 (uhh) But the movie's about how two Americans go backpacking through Europe and they're just trying to have a good time, but they go to this hostel and eventually they get kidnapped and they get tortured, tortured (stutter)
213619	43.582	47.346	0.3333333432674408	8	 So if you can get past that it's not that bad
214095	65.622	67.5	-2.6666667461395264	11	 (umm) Don't see this movie
214095	56.234	64.018	-2.3333332538604736	10	 And this one, I mean, you can laugh about it being so bad but (uhh) that's about it
214095	70.361	76.989	-2.0	13	 (umm) It's incredibly predictable and Carlos Mencia is in it who steals jokes
214095	67.169	69.186	-2.3333332538604736	12	 It's not a good movie
214095	76.687	79.463	0.0	14	 So don't see it
214095	3.603	9.592	0.0	1	 (umm) I'm here right now reviewing the movie currently in theaters called The Heartbreak Kid
214095	1.498	3.945	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello expotv
214095	12.663	27.9	0.0	3	 (uhh) It's about this guy that marries this girl and while they're on his (stutter), while they're on their honeymoon he finds someone who he loves more, or he begins to fall in love with and so it's kind of about that
214095	9.31	11.657	-1.3333333730697632	2	 (umm) This movie stars Ben Stiller
214095	31.37	36.461	-1.0	5	 (uhh) {laugh} It's probably the most predictable comedy I've ever seen
214095	28.686	30.674	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) This movie's awful
214095	40.649	48.224	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) Most of the jokes I can put together before they were finished and it was just bad
214095	36.099	40.262	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (uhh) You don't you don't (stutter) have to be clever to know what's about to happen
214095	50.008	57.234	-0.6666666865348816	9	 His movies aren't always, don't always have the best plot but at least they make you laugh
214095	47.224	50.579	-0.6666666865348816	8	 I mean Ben Stiller is usually pretty funny
215259	56.573	61.484	0.0	11	 (umm) I know you'll miss the 3D, but I would wait for the DVD
215259	50.776	56.495	-0.3333333432674408	10	 (umm) I kinda only recommend (uhh) going to see it in matinee
215259	8.153	12.086	-1.0	1	 (uhh) This movie was a little bit disappointing to me
215259	1.558	7.397	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello Expo TV, I'm here to review Beowulf in three D
215259	16.833	22.433	-1.0	3	 (umm) But when you go and it's adapted to film I I (stutter) just don't think it was done as well
215259	11.765	16.845	1.3333333730697632	2	 (uhh) After reading the book the classic, it's obviously an amazing tale
215259	24.127	33.398	1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the three D at the theater I was at when (uhh) after I adjusted I thought it looked beautiful
215259	21.941	24.298	2.0	4	 The animation was excellent
215259	37.945	41.948	-1.3333333730697632	7	 But on the overall, (uhh) I was kinda disappointed
215259	33.485	38.486	1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) Especially the last fighting scene, I thought that was the best part of the movie
215259	45.209	51.068	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) So if I were to go see this full price, I I (stutter) would not recommend it
215259	41.307	44.752	-1.3333333730697632	8	 I I (stutter) thought it should have been a little bit deeper
216007	147.835	150.941	0.0	24	 (umm) And that's the kind of thing they do in this movie
216007	149.941	153.634	-1.0	25	 And I think that makes it kind of painful
216007	153.792	156.977	2.0	26	 (umm) The only up side is the special effects are fantastic
216007	155.977	161.317	0.6666666865348816	27	 The previous adaptation of Hitchhiker was done by the BBC on a shoestring budget
216007	132.52	134.658	0.0	20	 It's like their evening show
216007	135.873	140.504	-2.3333332538604736	21	 That's just a really, really obvious, stupid mistake
216007	139.504	142.889	-1.3333333730697632	22	 Why did they have to make that joke? It's not that good
216007	142.238	147.528	-1.3333333730697632	23	 Considering it got something so completely wrong, I think Douglas Adams fans would just grit their teeth
216007	160.317	162.205	-1.6666666269302368	28	 It looks awful
216007	161.534	163.991	-0.3333333432674408	29	 It's great, but it looks terrible
216007	0.48	9.592	1.6666666269302368	1	 I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, based on the beloved series of books by Douglas Adams, may he rest in peace
216007	0.101	1.46	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi
216007	17.342	26.254	0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) Part of, I think, that the remarkable thing about the books is Douglas Adams wrote them sequentially, with no planning ahead of time as to what was gonna to happen
216007	10.897	16.536	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm) I'm not entirely convinced that the people who made this movie understood the books at all
216007	34.104	37.498	0.6666666865348816	5	 (uhh) That's part of what makes them so amazing
216007	25.314	32.141	0.6666666865348816	4	 And yet, they all come around into an incredibly tight plot and theme
216007	45.837	48.384	-0.6666666865348816	7	 They're certainly not going to now, I don't think
216007	36.498	46.558	-1.6666666269302368	6	 And this movie destroys all of that by sort of creating its own (umm) self-contained plot because I guess they weren't planning on making more movies
216007	54.657	59.728	-1.0	9	 (umm) They just {sigh} it's hard to explain if you're not a Douglas Adams fan
216007	48.411	51.866	-2.0	8	 (umm) Since no one really liked it that much
216007	61.502	66.981	-1.0	11	 To really feel what it was they got wrong, there's just a feeling missing
216007	58.728	61.943	0.0	10	 You haven't, you know, read all the books and seen the movie
216007	81.756	83.913	-1.0	13	 (umm) It's not a great adaptation
216007	65.981	81.468	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Everything that he intended and all these sort of (umm) jokes that he meant to be funny in a particular way just aren't the same, and they've added a lot of their own jokes that are funny in a very different way, not not (stutter) what he would have wanted
216007	88.909	106.172	0.0	15	 And I think the greatest example of that is the line at the very end, when Alan Rickman as the robot says, they're (stutter) heading to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is the name of the second, the second (stutter) novel in the series, and is an actual setting in the novel
216007	82.913	89.76	-1.0	14	 Is it a good movie? I suppose it's kind of amusing in its own way, but it's not a good adaptation of the story
216007	114.81	123.094	-1.6666666269302368	17	 The restaurant was not, even if you casually read Douglas Adams, you know the restaurant is not at the physical end of the universe, it's at the temporal end of the universe
216007	106.559	114.523	-0.6666666865348816	16	 And he says, not that anyone cares, or asked me, or whatever, but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe
216007	130.704	133.52	-0.6666666865348816	19	 And that's sort of the main attraction of the restaurant
216007	122.463	131.405	0.3333333432674408	18	 It's a place where you can go, utilizing time travel, you can go to this particular point in time, at just the point the universe ends, and watch it end
216007	165.036	175.545	-2.6666667461395264	31	 So, you know, whatever you want to sacrifice, I guess, but, (uhh) no, this movie doesn't capture the spirit of the story at all
216007	163.18	165.547	-2.3333332538604736	30	 This movie is terrible, and looks great
21638	3.902	10.32	0.0	1	 A Korean war film, (umm) the title actually translates to The Brotherhood of War
21638	0.0	4.454	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi I will review for you the special collector's edition of Tae Guk Gi
21638	15.416	24.079	1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) It's a really stylized film, so you can really get the grittiness of war that's going on all the battles and stuff in this, in the movie
21638	10.767	16.007	0.0	2	 (umm) The movie itself is a lot like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers
21638	34.982	53.462	0.0	5	 (umm) As far as the actual disc, (uhh) DVD collection goes, (uhh) it comes in a two disc set, (uhh) the first disc is the widescreen version of the film and the second disc is a bonus disc that comes with about three hours of footage of behind the scenes, cast documentaries, and outtakes
21638	23.658	32.989	0.0	4	 (umm) It is about a the story between of two brothers who are forced to join a war going on in Korea, between the north the north (stutter) and south
21638	53.859	59.698	2.0	6	 (umm) It is a really well made movie and a really well made (uhh) DVD collector's edition
216857	94.626	97.382	-0.3333333432674408	20	 It's a pretty long movie
216857	96.702	103.359	0.0	21	 And (umm) the DVD is available on Amazon dot com, along with pretty much any DVD retail
216857	0.0	3.486	0.0	1	 This is my review of Message in a Bottle
216857	0.0	0.782	0.0	0	Hi
216857	18.33	21.724	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) I'm probably in the minority of people
216857	4.042	16.576	0.0	2	 (umm) This is a movie starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman which was based on the best-selling Nicholas Sparks novel (umm) also entitled Message in a Bottle
216857	27.249	30.594	-0.3333333432674408	5	 And (umm) not surprising
216857	21.113	28.05	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) I know it's got a lot of good ratings and stuff when it came out, but, really, not one of my favorite movies
216857	31.111	33.667	-0.6666666865348816	7	 This was actually given to me as a gift
216857	29.923	32.111	-0.3333333432674408	6	 I mean, I did watch
216857	38.284	47.117	-2.6666667461395264	9	 (uhh) It always seems really cliche to me and (umm) tries to be deep, but it's really not
216857	32.827	39.155	-1.0	8	 But (uhh) I don't really care for Nicholas Sparks' (umm) writing that much
216857	51.634	55.767	0.0	11	 And it (uhh) I mean, it was okay
216857	47.304	52.634	-1.0	10	 (uhh) So I, you know, wasn't (uhh) crazy about watching this movie in the first place
216857	56.762	61.185	0.3333333432674408	13	 It's not like I shut it off in the middle or anything
216857	54.767	57.762	0.0	12	 I, I (stutter) watched it through
216857	64.754	71.97	0.3333333432674408	15	 But (umm) (uhh), you know, I would recommend it if you like the Nicholas Sparks books
216857	60.185	65.235	0.6666666865348816	14	 It was worth (umm) watching on a, you know, boring afternoon
216857	76.937	84.532	-0.3333333432674408	17	 I didn't find him, I did read the book before I saw the movie, and (uhh) he didn't really fit
216857	71.229	77.937	-1.0	16	 And (uhh) also, not a huge Kevin Costner fan, so (umm) not really up for that
216857	91.553	95.626	0.0	19	 (umm) But the movie itself is one-hundred-and-thirty-one minutes long
216857	84.07	91.496	-0.3333333432674408	18	 I don't know how I saw the character exactly, but (uhh) (umm) that's just my personal opinion
218708	48.601	60.776	0.0	11	 And (umm) also, this other guy is going to help (umm) do the bills, the character who is (umm) played by (uhh) Jason Bateman
218708	38.973	49.421	0.0	10	 And (umm) so he leaves, he's going to leave the store to (umm) Natalie Portman's character to, you know, run and keep it going
218708	67.318	84.162	-0.3333333432674408	13	 And (umm) the movie kind of goes, follows (umm) the decisions and how they affect (umm) those two characters in relation to, like, who owns the store and (umm) how the store handles (umm) each one of those characters
218708	60.524	68.159	-1.0	12	 And (umm) this guy is really, like, drab and doesn't believe in the magic of the store and (umm) is just generally a jerk
218708	90.516	95.985	-2.0	15	 (umm) The story is kind of blur and drab and it's just so so
218708	83.162	90.498	-0.6666666865348816	14	 So it's really a fantastical, fantasy-like movie and (umm) it's not really that good
218708	97.54	100.156	-1.6666666269302368	17	 I give it, like, two stars
218708	95.574	98.54	-1.0	16	 So I don't really recommend it
218708	100.423	107.16	-0.6666666865348816	19	 (umm) Even though there's a lot of, like, famous good actors and actresses (umm) it still doesn't make up for just the bad story
218708	99.196	101.184	-0.6666666865348816	18	 It's not very good
218708	0.141	6.13	0.3333333432674408	1	 Today on ExpoTV I'm going to be reviewing the movie Mr
218708	-0.128	1.141	0.0	0	Hi
218708	6.866	9.532	0.0	3	 And Mr
218708	5.17	6.968	0.0	2	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium
218708	19.846	28.15	0.3333333432674408	5	 And (umm) basically it's about (umm) this guy, Dustin Hoffman, named Mr
218708	8.532	19.978	0.3333333432674408	4	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium is (umm) a movie that's in theaters now and it stars (umm) Jason Bateman and (uhh) Natalie Portman and Dustin Hoffman
218708	27.15	30.015	0.3333333432674408	7	 And he has this huge magic shop
218708	29.015	31.911	0.0	8	 And there's, like, tons of stuff going on
218708	31.839	38.915	0.0	9	 And (umm) he, he (stutter) says (umm) it's time for him to leave, which kind of implies, like, he's going to die
218708	106.16	108.477	-0.6666666865348816	20	 So (umm) yeah, don't see it
219310	72.277	78.036	-2.0	10	 I guess if you're a huge dragon fan you might wanna check it out, but (umm) this definitely a pass for me
219310	2.975	20.527	-0.6666666865348816	1	 Reign of Fire is a movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale and it's about this dragon that's found in the earth and (uhh) basically all hell rains loose when it gets freed, the world is pretty much being destroyed and (umm) {sigh} there's not much to say about this movie
219310	0.45	3.825	0.0	0	Corbitt here, reviewing the movie Reign of Fire
219310	24.516	32.55	-1.3333333730697632	3	 Christian Bale has done a lot of good movies and {sigh} I don't know what happened but (umm) this isn't that good of a movie
219310	19.836	25.156	1.0	2	 You know, I'm a huge fan of both the stars, Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale
219310	38.414	41.24	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) It's just not that good of an action movie
219310	33.146	38.476	-2.3333332538604736	4	 (umm) You'd think even these two great actors could save it, but that's not the case
219310	47.922	55.837	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) It seems a little over the top even for having a dragon in it and (umm) it's just not that good
219310	40.509	47.735	-1.0	6	 The conversations with the people are just, like, they don't sound right, they don't sound real
219310	70.042	73.008	-2.0	9	 But (umm) I really wouldn't recommend this
219310	56.214	70.533	0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) Surprisingly with this movie they added a lot of extra features including a making of dragons, a pyrotechnics featurette, (uhh) conversations with the director, a trailer, and surround sound
219775	5.429	18.771	-1.6666666269302368	1	 I did not particularly enjoy the first All Dogs Go to Heaven movie, so needless to say I was less than thrilled when my mother in law got my kids this next All Dogs Go to Heaven movie
219775	0.0	5.192	0.0	0	Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD movie All Dogs Go to Heaven Two
219775	23.348	25.047	0.0	3	 Definitely
219775	18.928	23.82	-1.3333333730697632	2	 (umm) My kids really didn't enjoy this one, either, and I didn't
219775	28.706	34.186	-0.3333333432674408	5	 It does not include the little orphan girl from the first movie Anne Marie
219775	24.526	29.706	0.0	4	 It includes the dogs from the first movie, Charlie and Barkin
219775	47.044	57.483	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) (uhh) There's supposed to be a lot of thrills in this movie I didn't find it that thrilling and there's some villains in the movie that kind of make it a little bit dark so I don't really think it's that great for children
219775	33.755	46.069	1.0	6	 And this movie has a little boy in it, so I guess it would be good (umm) for (umm) little boys to relate to this guy more than the girl in the first one
219775	58.419	69.546	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) So I definitely would not recommend purchasing this movie, if you have to see it then I would definitely recommend renting it before {laughter} you (umm) spend the money to buy it
21Kxt5L9OBE	28.716	37.229	1.3333333730697632	3	I thinks it's an unfortunate occurrence at this time and it is our hope that it resolves itself quickly and peacefully.
21Kxt5L9OBE	17.172	29.716	0.0	2	Whether they are related or not is another question [INAUDIBLE ]. I'm also concerned about what this does to the climate crisis as well.
220134	132.81	134.348	-0.6666666865348816	24	 (umm) It's bad
220134	134.725	145.433	-1.6666666269302368	25	 (stutter) I think there are people who get some sort of sick enjoyment out of this movie, but it's not quite in the so-bad-it's-good category, especially if you are a James Bond fan, it's very painful to watch this at times
220134	145.311	149.514	0.6666666865348816	26	 On the other hand, if you're a really devoted fan, you need to own this anyway
220134	148.973	164.799	-2.6666667461395264	27	 (umm) I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you're a severe masochist, but again, it does come in the final (umm) the final set of, of (stutter) the James Bond (uhh) the complete DVD collection, so you'll probably end up with it anyway if you're a completist like me
220134	102.738	104.795	0.0	20	 (umm) James Bond in Space
220134	104.095	111.351	-2.3333332538604736	21	 How much more ridiculous can you get? I saw this movie on TV when I was about ten, but this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
220134	110.949	118.714	0.0	22	 Jaws, from the Spy Who Loved Me, (uhh) played by Richard Kiel, is brought back as like a good guy in this for some reason
220134	117.734	133.091	-2.0	23	 I guess he was a popular character and they wanted to reuse him, and he has like a love interest with Pigtails, and it's so so very, oh oh it's just upsetting
220134	164.438	167.054	0.0	28	 And (umm) you know (ehh) it's alright
220134	1.418	4.114	0.3333333432674408	1	 I'm Liz, and I'm here to talk to you about Moonraker
220134	1.049	2.418	0.0	0	Hi
220134	7.055	13.683	0.0	3	 (umm) It is the eleventh James Bond film, fourth to star Roger Moore as James Bond
220134	3.244	7.008	-1.3333333730697632	2	 This is a ridiculous movie
220134	21.203	27.761	0.0	5	 It also contains Octopussy, Tomorrow Never Dies, You Only Live Twice, and Doctor No
220134	13.321	22.024	1.0	4	 It is available by itself, or as part of the Ultimate Edition Volume Four in the James Bond Collections, this nice silver one
220134	29.724	33.547	-1.0	7	 It's very loosely based on the novel Moonraker by Ian Fleming
220134	27.519	30.724	-1.3333333730697632	6	 This movie, as I say, is completely ridiculous
220134	44.041	51.098	0.0	9	 They originally were going to do For Your Eyes Only as the next film, and they put that off until after, because they wanted to get this out there
220134	33.934	44.373	0.0	8	 (umm) It was actually chosen (uhh) for release at this moment (uhh) in time because of the popularity of Star Wars (stutter) at the time, had been very recent
220134	53.28	66.951	-0.6666666865348816	11	 (umm) The character of Holly Goodhead yes, that's an actual Bondgirl name, a lot of people think that's a parody or something from Austin Powers no Holly Goodhead, that was her name, is a complete
220134	50.726	52.794	-1.6666666269302368	10	 That was a really bad idea
220134	73.085	76.29	-1.0	15	 There's no such character in the novel, she's completely ridiculous
220134	66.41	74.085	-1.0	14	 (umm) She's of course a NASA scientist, because what bond girl wouldn't be? (uhh) She is a total invention of the film
220134	81.676	88.443	-1.0	17	 (umm) Apparently, (uhh) she's she's (stutter) quite dull, (uhh) the actress who, who (stutter) played the part
220134	75.51	81.858	-2.0	16	 Who, who (stutter) on Earth would have, have (stutter) that name and act like that, I don't know
220134	89.418	102.191	-0.3333333432674408	19	 Presumably, the actress, and the entire rest of her family are just as dull, because she claims she's able to convince her grandmother that the name of Goodhead referred to her having a good head on her shoulders, I don't know
220134	87.443	89.73	-0.6666666865348816	18	 Well, the character's dull
220200	60.374	67.959	0.0	11	 There's (uhh) like the production notes, the cast and the filmmakers, and the theatrical trailers
220200	56.433	61.374	0.3333333432674408	10	 (umm) But this DVD has some special features that come along with this movie
220200	75.3	77.158	-1.6666666269302368	13	 Didn't like it at all
220200	67.538	76.3	-1.6666666269302368	12	 So in fact believe me I preferred the trailers over the movie, that's how bad I (uhh) you know I thought this movie was
220200	5.419	11.288	0.0	1	 Screwed stars (uhh) Norm MacDonald, Dave Chappelle, and Danny DeVito
220200	0.45	6.03	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Screwed
220200	18.559	21.844	-1.0	3	 It's it's (stutter) not good, I mean
220200	12.154	19.4	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (uhh) Well nothing much to tell about this movie that, you know, but it's it's (stutter) bad
220200	32.019	36.171	0.0	5	 (uhh) Got this DVD from a friend and (uhh) watched it
220200	21.443	31.901	-1.3333333730697632	4	 So they have tried to make this as a kind of cheesy comedy movie and, you know, something from the team of Saturday Night Live or something like that
220200	36.508	40.172	-1.3333333730697632	7	 I mean, (uhh) the jokes are kind of old
220200	35.431	37.508	-3.0	6	 I didn't like it at all
220200	41.996	56.136	-1.0	9	 I mean you have to kind of make yourself laugh if you have to but there's they have build up a story, it's a little dramatic but (uhh) most of it is old and there's nothing not a new idea in there
220200	40.13	42.996	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (uhh) You know, there's not much laughter
220548	131.742	138.07	-2.3333332538604736	20	 And of course everyone learns a valuable lesson about not using people or whatever, I don't know
220548	137.07	150.502	-2.3333332538604736	21	 I just don't like this movie and (uhh) I'm sick of talking about it so quite frankly if this kind of movie is your style, (umm) if this is the kind of movie you like and you know if it is then I'm sure you'll love this movie
220548	150.17	155.061	-1.3333333730697632	22	 If you're not a big fan of this type of movie don't even bother
220548	154.061	159.361	-2.0	23	 It's not any better than any of the others and (uhh) you'll find it quite dull and unfunny
220548	1.229	13.583	0.0	1	 I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about Kingpin which is from the guys who brought There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber according to the back of the DVD case which should give you some indication about (uhh) what kind of movie this is
220548	0.77	2.229	-0.6666666865348816	0	Hi
220548	20.415	29.477	-2.0	3	" (umm) I saw the trailer for Kingpin many years ago, it was attached to some (uhh) DVD that I watched pretty often and every time I saw it I thought ""man that movie looks so stupid"""
220548	13.521	19.33	0.0	2	 (umm) It stars Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Vanessa Angel, whoever she is
220548	33.834	41.569	1.0	5	" It's (umm) it's a lot funnier than the trailer cause in the trailer they couldn't use a lot of the, you know, more raunchy humor"" and it's like okay, fine, you know"
220548	29.065	34.834	0.3333333432674408	4	" And then (uhh) I saw that (uhh) my boyfriend owned it and he said ""oh you should give it, you should give it a shot"
220548	42.784	47.945	-0.3333333432674408	7	 When will I learn to trust my instincts? I don't know
220548	41.347	43.016	0.3333333432674408	6	 I'll give it a chance
220548	51.784	60.067	-2.6666667461395264	9	 It has a few sort of chuckle moments with kind an aww ending, but other than that no way
220548	46.945	52.424	-1.3333333730697632	8	 Anyway (umm) Kingpin I I (stutter) didn't think was particularly funny
220548	60.683	76.35	-1.0	11	 And (stutter) granted it is a kind of There's Something About Mary, American Pie style of humor that has never appealed to me really (umm) and it's not that it's vulgar because I don't mind that at all, it's that that is what is supposed to be funny about it
220548	59.067	61.614	-2.0	10	 Kingpin's not funny to me at all
220548	83.342	89.56	0.0	13	 The basis of the humor is the delivery of the line and how people sort of interact with each other
220548	75.56	84.342	1.6666666269302368	12	 If it was a movie like Superbad (umm) which came out recently, very, very funny and it's incredibly vulgar but that's not the basis of the humor
220548	95.335	97.931	-2.0	15	 I don't know
220548	90.067	96.005	-1.3333333730697632	14	 And there's just so much more realism to it and more heart to it and this is just bleh
220548	99.695	107.449	-2.0	17	 I've never really liked a movie with Bill Murray in it (umm) that I can recall and (uhh) it's not that I have anything against him, I just have never liked him
220548	97.809	100.695	-0.3333333432674408	16	 (umm) Bill Murray is in it, (stutter) that might be why
220548	110.63	131.644	0.0	19	 (umm) Anyway (uhh) to talk really more in detail about this movie Woody Harrelson is a pro bowler who loses his hand, can't bowl anymore, finds a (uhh) naive Amish guy who can bowl really well and his plan is to win some prize money for a bowling tournament using this (umm) this Amish fellow
220548	107.128	109.465	-1.3333333730697632	18	 And maybe he ruined it for me
221740	1.308	7.816	0.3333333432674408	1	 My name's Lindsay and I'm here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Stuck on You
221740	0.0	0.732	0.0	0	Hi expotv
221740	17.033	21.345	0.0	3	 Therefore they cannot be separate because they need their liver to survive
221740	7.195	18.033	0.0	2	 This stars Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as (stutter) conjoined twins (uhh) who are combined, who are adjoined I guess at the liver
221740	32.527	43.505	-3.0	5	 It is stupid, ridiculous, slapstick, like really cheesy, cheesy lines that they think they're funny and I don't think they're funny
221740	22.45	33.527	-3.0	4	 (umm) This movie is made by the Farrelly brothers, who also made There's Something About Mary and all I have to say if you like There's Something About Mary you will hate this movie
221740	59.007	65.335	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) But I don't like this movie (uhh) but you can check it out (uhh) anywhere you buy DVDs
221740	43.243	59.239	-2.3333332538604736	6	 So I really can't recommend this movie {laugh} (umm) but on the DVD it has (umm) a audio comedy by the Farrelly brothers, (uhh) has deleted scenes, a bloopers reel, (uhh) a theatrical teaser and trailer, things like that
221740	64.335	69.925	0.3333333432674408	8	 Again it's Stuck on You, the DVD movie starring Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon
222116	7.993	17.464	-2.0	1	 (umm) The only part that I could find to play for you was the opening credits because everything else is insanely crude and terrible
222116	0.0	7.716	1.0	0	Hi ExpoTV, I'm here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Jackass The Movie
222116	20.704	23.74	0.6666666865348816	3	 (uhh) So that should tell you something about the movie
222116	16.803	20.906	-0.3333333432674408	2	 And this is the least offensive part that I could find to play
222116	27.03	30.734	0.3333333432674408	5	 Should be rated more if there's rating more than that
222116	22.999	27.771	-0.6666666865348816	4	 This movie is not for children, it is rated R, R, R
222116	42.295	54.36	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) It is raunchy at its best and lots of people getting hurt and doing insane things that you and I would probably never imagine to do, but these guys did
222116	30.572	42.537	0.0	6	 (umm) It has a (uhh) restriction on it, it says (uhh) that it is rated R for dangerous sometimes extremely crude stunts, language and nudity, and that is an understatement
222116	54.418	66.193	1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) So if you like that kind of stuff, (uhh) go out and get this movie, (uhh) it is again Jackass The Movie on DVD, and it's rated R for your entertainment
223926	12.114	22.632	-1.3333333730697632	1	 A movie kind of suitable for Christmas and families, but (stutter) ultimately falls flat because Fred Claus just isn't a really good movie
223926	0.59	12.665	0.0	0	Fred Claus, a current movie in theaters, is about Santa Claus's older brother, Fred Claus, who is forced to move to the north pole
223926	26.96	41.03	-1.3333333730697632	3	 It's kind of like, a good set of actors but an awful script, bad directing, and the, the story is nothing to really talk about
223926	24.296	27.691	0.0	2	 (umm) The actors many of you may know
223926	58.109	67.76	1.0	5	 (umm) So I guess I would recommend this only to people who have families that they like to go see it with, and have a decent time
223926	43.323	56.874	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) The, it's basically a comedy, right? And when you go to see a comedy you expect to laugh, you expect to have a good time, and although Fred Claus is very silly and you shouldn't go in expecting much, it's really not funny
223926	75.839	91.186	-2.6666667461395264	7	 (umm) Fred Claus is a movie I definitely do not recommend, unless you're taking children to see it, and with such actors you wouldn't imagine having such a bad script and directing and everything like that
223926	67.169	75.552	0.0	6	 But there's a lot of other comedies out there, even if they're not suited for teenagers and people in their twenties and thirties
223926	90.615	92.414	0.0	8	 Fred Claus
224599	68.336	85.02	-2.0	11	 (umm) once again {clears throat} I'm not really into this (uhh) type of (uhh) genre, I guess (umm) my husband was helping me out and he said, if you give this one a bad review I don't know what to say and I was like well, I didn't say anything, but I'm definitely giving it like a two out of five
224599	52.123	68.079	0.0	10	 (umm) over an hour of deleted scenes, live footage from the feature commentary (stutter) session, featurettes, theatrical trailers, (umm) soundtrack presentation, (uhh) by the Goofs Build Me Up Buttercup and production photographs
224599	84.31	89.8	-0.6666666865348816	12	 Definitely not my cup of tea, but if you like that (uhh) genre then you're gonna like it
224599	2.546	7.546	0.3333333432674408	1	 You can (umm) check out my profile at PM three two one

224599	37.297	40.023	1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) We do have some good special features
224772	93.06	95.756	-0.3333333432674408	11	 Well blockbuster it was not
224772	83.172	93.96	-1.6666666269302368	10	 So it was a big downer, especially since I did not realize, you know, this was the beginning of (uhh) a blockbuster (umm) hit that was supposed to (uhh) go into effect
224772	96.382	99.268	-2.6666667461395264	13	 We'll see if they continue this terrible series
224772	95.524	97.382	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (uhh) Not recommended
224772	98.667	103.139	-2.0	14	 Would not recommend seeing The Golden Compass in theaters this season
224772	4.581	7.746	-1.6666666269302368	1	 The Golden Compass in my opinion was a turkey
224772	0.58	5.481	0.0	0	Hi, this is Dan with a review of The Golden Compass, available in theaters nationwide
224772	9.839	12.675	0.0	3	 (umm) Partially probably because I never read the book
224772	7.175	9.821	-1.6666666269302368	2	 Absolutely thought it was terrible
224772	23.179	35.403	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (uhh) The Golden Compass spent so much time trying to (uhh) lucidly (uhh) portray and introduce new characters that there was really never any character development, nor do you really get a sense of what was going on
224772	12.373	23.68	-1.0	4	 (umm) But even so (uhh) if you've seen The Chronicles of Narnia think of The Golden (uhh) Compass providing the action that Chronicles of Narnia missed but none of the story line
224772	57.022	63.07	-1.0	7	 (umm) Unfortunately after she meets all this a brief scuffle occurs and the movie ends all too quickly
224772	35.491	57.054	0.0	6	 (umm) Basically you have a little girl who ends up going to the north in this fantasy world with friends Iorek, (uhh) which is a ice bear, (umm) played by a (uhh) Ian McKellen's voice and (umm) runs into (uhh) unraveling (uhh) secrets of her past and of her future as she meets a variety of different people
224772	80.478	84.172	0.0	9	 Oh wait, in the next movie in this installment
224772	62.659	81.029	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (uhh) For example one of the star features in there, who you know, I thought was (uhh) one of the main leads in the movie doesn't even show up for most of the movie, and that would be our friend (uhh) (stutter) Daniel Craig, better known as the new James Bond (umm) who plays a (stutter) major character in this movie
224817	0.0	8.744	0.0	0	{noise} Hi ExpoTV my name is Lindsey and I am here today to talk to you about the DVD movie A Clockwork Orange
224869	72.527	75.771	-2.3333332538604736	11	 I would not recommend this one though
224869	68.945	73.088	-1.0	10	 (uhh) That doesn't mean that you won't like it, it just means that I didn't like it
224869	81.935	90.259	-1.3333333730697632	13	 (umm) If you like to see random things blow up, well this one might be for you but I I (stutter) really didn't see much plot in it
224869	75.39	82.237	-2.3333332538604736	12	 (umm) It's long, it's drawn out, it takes a long time to even get started
224869	91.154	94.579	-1.0	15	 (umm) So I would not recommend this one
224869	89.259	91.156	-1.6666666269302368	14	 Very slow
224869	0.869	11.547	1.3333333730697632	1	 Today I'm reviewing Munich directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Eric Bana and Daniel Craig (uhh) from the most recent double-oh-seven movie
224869	0.021	1.38	0.6666666865348816	0	Hello
224869	21.912	41.08	0.0	3	 (uhh) There were eleven of them that were assassinated and Eric Bana's character (stutter) and a group of (umm) other Israeli soldiers are hired to go and track down the Palestinians (uhh) that are believed to have killed (uhh) these eleven athletes
224869	11.395	22.443	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (uhh) This movie basically is about (uhh) the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Olympic massacre of the Israeli (umm) Olympians
224869	44.919	48.384	0.3333333432674408	5	 It works it from the very beginning all the way through
224869	40.898	45.879	0.0	4	 (umm) And it's really that story (umm) from cradle to grave
224869	54.647	58.84	-1.0	7	 (umm) Again (stutter) maybe it's just I didn't get it
224869	48.192	54.679	-2.0	6	 (umm) I got to say for this to be a Steven Spielberg movie I wasn't really thrilled with it
224869	67.508	69.496	-1.6666666269302368	9	 I didn't like it
224869	58.259	67.42	1.0	8	 (uhh) But it was definitely praised by the critics, it actually got (uhh) five Academy Award nominations (umm) when it came out
225343	68.196	71.681	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) I don't know that it makes it any better though
225343	64.215	68.019	0.3333333432674408	10	 (umm) It does have an alternate ending in the bonus features
225343	72.936	80.66	0.3333333432674408	13	 Also some outtakes from Billy Bob Thornton, some director's commentary, bloopers, (uhh) things like that
225343	70.721	73.756	0.3333333432674408	12	 (uhh) But take a look at that (stutter) alternate ending
225343	88.46	90.608	-0.6666666865348816	15	 There's nothing to it
225343	80.309	89.111	-1.6666666269302368	14	 (umm) So if I had to recommend this one I would probably stay away from it just because it's blah
225343	90.436	94.319	-1.6666666269302368	16	 (umm) So I would probably not recommend this one
225343	7.893	16.217	-0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) This movie is kind of a crime spoof, (uhh) for lack of a better word
225343	0.0	7.846	0.0	0	Hi, tonight I'm reviewing The Ice Harvest starring Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack
225343	19.327	37.718	2.0	3	 (uhh) Essentially you have John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton who pair up to actually steal money (umm) from a crime boss played by Randy Randy (stutter) Quaid, who actually does a really good job providing some comedic relief (umm) to this one
225343	15.217	19.729	0.6666666865348816	2	 I (uhh) guess you could say a comedic gangster movie
225343	47.284	50.459	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (uhh) Parts of it are really really farfetched
225343	37.586	48.154	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) When they steal the money {clears throat} excuse me, they have to go through and do (uhh) go through the night and cross all kinds of stuff
225343	53.869	56.984	0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) But it's only small parts
225343	49.509	53.552	2.3333332538604736	6	 Parts of it are bust your gut funny though
225343	61.751	64.347	-0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) So not a lot above that
225343	55.984	62.182	0.3333333432674408	8	 Pretty much what they showed in the previews that looked funny, that's what's gonna be funny in this video
225416	72.527	75.991	-2.0	11	 I really didn't care for this movie
225416	72.048	73.527	-1.0	10	 I don't know
225416	78.244	80.91	1.0	13	 (umm) Some of the actors are okay
225416	75.639	78.545	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (uhh) It doesn't add anything new to the franchise
225416	87.413	100.914	-1.3333333730697632	15	 (umm) As far as (umm) special features go on this disc, (uhh) the only thing that's on here is (umm) some interviews with the cast and crew, so if you, you know, are looking for some special features, this is not the edition to go for
225416	80.868	86.996	-2.0	14	 (umm) Weaver does her best with what she's given, and (uhh) but it really doesn't amount to much in my opinion
225416	101.022	103.299	-3.0	16	 (umm) I really don't like this movie
225416	1.268	7.616	-2.6666667461395264	1	 Playing over my shoulder here is Alien Resurrection, (uhh) and it's a pretty stupid movie
225416	0.0	1.76	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hello everyone
225416	9.58	12.745	2.3333332538604736	3	 (uhh) Aliens is a very good movie
225416	7.664	10.111	2.3333332538604736	2	 (uhh) The first Alien is a good movie
225416	17.741	33.148	-2.0	5	 (uhh) Sigourney Weaver, who died at the end of Alien three, is (uhh) genetically (uhh) brought back to life so she can star in another sequel that (uhh) tries very, very hard to be funny and just ends up being not funny at all
225416	11.745	17.963	-1.6666666269302368	4	 Alien three is not so good of a movie, and this is the worst of the four (uhh) in my opinion
225416	53.849	62.192	-1.6666666269302368	7	 He directed this and I don't think he spoke English when he directed this, otherwise he may, might might (stutter) have have noticed how terrible a lot of the dialogue in this movie is
225416	32.986	54.58	2.6666667461395264	6	 (umm) It has really good cinematography and a really good visual style the guy who directed it (umm), Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I'm not sure if I pronounced his name properly, I don't speak French, so pardon me, (umm) he also directed (umm) City of Lost Children and Delicatessen and (uhh) Amelie, (uhh) which is a pretty good movie
225416	67.288	72.349	0.0	9	 He (uhh) wrote, I think, some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer
225416	63.208	68.019	0.0	8	 (umm) It was written by (umm) Joss Whedon, that's right
225768	73.714	85.839	-2.0	11	 (uhh) When you see the ending, if you ever see the ending, you will probably think it's the stupidest thing you've ever seen before because (uhh) it's it's (stutter) really over the top the way they ended this one
225768	69.633	74.385	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (umm) Movie not all that great, like I said really, really farfetched
225768	88.909	101.204	0.0	13	 (uhh) Some director's commentary, some (stutter) deleted and/or extended scenes, (umm) and some making of the movie documentary diary type (umm) entries
225768	84.839	89.42	0.0	12	 A few (umm) bonus features on this one
225768	105.601	110.333	-2.3333332538604736	15	 I probably wouldn't even waste my time to (uhh) to watch it
225768	100.204	106.422	-2.3333332538604736	14	 So as far as this one goes I would say definitely (uhh) leave it on the shelf
225768	109.333	112.568	-2.0	16	 This one was definitely a disappointment for me
225768	0.7	10.6	0.0	1	 Today I'm reviewing Flight of the Phoenix, starring Dennis Quaid, (uhh) Tyrese Gibson, and (umm) Giovanni Ribisi
225768	0.041	1.361	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello
225768	16.234	20.507	0.6666666865348816	3	 (uhh) So it's interesting to see him in some of these old roles
225768	10.478	16.636	0.0	2	 (uhh) This movie also has Hugh Laurie in it (uhh) before he became House and really became famous
225768	29.065	34.126	0.0	5	 It's flying over a desert, (uhh) runs into a storm and crashes
225768	20.565	30.065	0.0	4	 (umm) This movie at at (stutter) its core is about (umm) a cargo plane with some mismatched passengers on it
225768	41.776	49.272	-1.0	7	 (umm) The way it ends and the story line of it altogether is really, really, really farfetched
225768	33.695	40.761	0.0	6	 (uhh) So the survivors that are left are all stranded in this desert and they're trying to find (umm) a way to get out
225768	53.739	68.508	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) Dennis Quaid (uhh) he used to be a really good actor, all of a sudden it seems like every single movie he's in he has the same exact expressions on his face (umm) so I'm not sure what's going on there but I'm definitely getting tired of seeing his scowl
225768	48.272	53.612	-1.3333333730697632	8	 You really have to buy into (uhh) movie magic to go along with this one
227173	69.194	74.055	-0.6666666865348816	11	 (uhh) But I definitely didn't think it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen
227173	66.71	69.436	0.0	10	 A couple of one liners here and there
227173	78.932	84.591	0.0	13	 (umm) As far as bonus foot, footage (stutter), there is actually some behind-the-scenes footage on here
227173	73.055	78.515	-0.6666666865348816	12	 I thought, you know, worth watching, maybe once, and then that was it
227173	95.355	100.605	-2.0	15	 So, for me, this one's only gonna pull a one out of five stars
227173	84.37	96.355	-2.3333332538604736	14	 (umm) The HBO first-look at this movie, (umm) some deleted scenes, some extended scenes, and even a blooper real, but even those things really don't help this movie out
227173	100.104	104.027	-2.0	16	 If you can see it for free, I'd see it for free
227173	7.714	18.721	-2.0	1	 (umm), I gotta say that when I heard Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy I actually thought it was going to be the funny, one of the funniest things I've ever seen before and it just didn't work
227173	0.0	7.836	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie Showtime, starring Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy
227173	21.233	32.58	0.0	3	 (uhh) Essentially the premise of it is, (umm), Robert Deniro is a, you know, a cop, defined by what you see on television, I mean, just a man's man
227173	19.128	21.395	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm), I don't like this movie
227173	35.561	42.268	-0.3333333432674408	5	 I, he's kind of bully, bullied (stutter) into (umm), participating in a (stutter) reality show
227173	31.58	36.221	0.3333333432674408	4	 He goes out and he, you know, he does what he's supposed to do by the rules
227173	47.663	58.99	-0.3333333432674408	7	 On the opposite end of the spectrum you have (stutter) Eddie Murphy's character who's kind of, arrogant, and all about being on TV, (uhh) ready for his time in the spotlight
227173	41.796	47.456	-1.0	6	 And he's not happy about that, so cameras are following him around night and day, (umm)
227173	65.293	67.71	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (uhh), Not very funny at all
227173	58.518	65.305	-1.3333333730697632	8	 And (umm), the chemistry between the two as friends just didn't come off
227416	87.842	91.685	0.0	11	 (uhh) So nothing big there, just a couple of things
227416	78.004	87.704	0.0	10	 (uhh) Just some cast bios, (uhh) it's dubbed in multiple language and (uhh) multiple languages and (uhh) it has the original theater trailer
227416	90.685	98.071	2.3333332538604736	12	 But definitely one that you want to add to your collection, especially if you are a gangster (uhh) movie fan
227416	8.492	14.102	0.0	1	 (uhh) This movie is actually the directorial debut (uhh) by Robert De Niro
227416	0.0	8.993	0.0	0	Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro and (stutter) Chazz Palmintiri
227416	22.909	38.845	0.0	3	 (uhh) Essentially Chazz Palmintiri is a crime boss and Robert De Niro is a bus driver, so you have two opposite sides of the tracks and in between these two gentlemen is Robert De Niro's son who is seeing the best of both worlds
227416	14.449	23.48	1.6666666269302368	2	 (umm) It's classic De Niro in the fact that it's kind of got a mafia overlay in everything that's going on
227416	52.741	60.586	0.0	5	 (umm) So he gets to see both sides of the story and has to make a decision on which way he's gonna go with it
227416	38.733	53.293	0.0	4	 (umm) He has his father that has everyone's respect because he earned it, but he has to work hard for it and he sees the crime boss who has everybody's respect because they're all scared to death of him
227416	63.188	66.243	0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) One that kind of makes you think
227416	60.374	63.39	2.3333332538604736	6	 (umm) It's a very very good movie
227416	74.312	78.326	0.0	9	 (umm) A couple of bonus features, not a whole lot
227416	65.991	74.105	2.6666667461395264	8	 (uhh) you can sit back, you can enjoy it and for a directorial debut it's definitely impressive on the side of Robert De Niro
227426	61.073	63.15	-0.3333333432674408	11	 We've seen it before
227426	56.503	61.703	-0.3333333432674408	10	 (umm) so really the basic story that's already been told
227426	66.081	70.972	-2.3333332538604736	13	 (umm) The movie, I didn't like the writing, I didn't like the premise behind it
227426	62.15	65.794	-2.0	12	 It's just she did not pull this role off
227426	74.632	77.607	0.0	15	 (umm) (stutter) Few special features on this one
227426	70.601	74.454	-2.3333332538604736	14	 (uhh) Definite only a one out of five stars for me
227426	80.129	86.776	0.6666666865348816	17	 (umm) Some director's commentary, some deleted scenes and even a behind the scenes look at the movie
227426	77.156	80.381	0.0	16	 A look at the women behind Vanity Fair
227426	89.458	92.952	-2.6666667461395264	19	 We're looking at one out of five stars on this one
227426	86.595	90.458	-2.0	18	 (uhh) But even those bonus features aren't going to make it any better
227426	6.936	16.237	-0.6666666865348816	1	 (uhh) This movie is a Focus Features release which means it's an independent film (umm) and you can really tell this is an indie film
227426	0.071	6.928	0.0	0	Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie Vanity Fair starring Reese Witherspoon
227426	19.128	22.183	2.6666667461395264	3	 (umm) I love Reese Witherspoon
227426	15.805	19.3	-1.0	2	 (umm) It may just be me but I didn't get this one
227426	24.576	29.646	1.0	5	 Love Sweet Home Alabama, (umm) all those movies
227426	21.183	25.576	2.0	4	 I think, you know, she does a great job in acting

227426	29.305	32.49	-2.6666667461395264	6	 This one was kind of horrible for me
227426	43.473	56.385	0.0	9	 (umm) Of course, you know, along the way she ends up meeting a guy and things, you know, one thing leads to another and (umm) that gets in the way of what she's trying to do

22821	53.091	56.535	0.6666666865348816	13	 (umm) It's described as the most powerful movie ever made
22821	48.272	52.454	2.0	12	 It's it's (stutter) one of those movies that until you see it you really can't describe it
22821	57.9	60.785	0.6666666865348816	15	 I wouldn't say that, because I really like Phantom
22821	55.535	58.64	0.0	14	 I wouldn't, (umm) (stutter) movie musical ever made
22821	62.439	64.507	1.3333333730697632	17	 It's one of those must-sees
22821	60.215	63.439	1.6666666269302368	16	 However, it was really good
22821	64.465	75.133	1.6666666269302368	18	 (umm) I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to everyone as, (uhh) like, who's a fan of musicals or is a fan of just Jewish culture or who just wants to see a really good movie
22821	2.705	16.117	1.3333333730697632	1	 {singing} You ever wonder where that came from? It's not Gwen Stefani, If I Were a Rich Girl

22821	32.667	34.834	1.6666666269302368	7	 It is very well done
22821	28.217	33.607	2.0	6	 I had never seen it before until this film, so, I was not let down
22821	38.324	45.879	1.3333333730697632	9	 (umm) Some other great songs besides the (uhh) If I were a rich man song is (uhh) matchmaker, matchmaker make me a match

22880	0.091	5.272	0.0	0	This is the widescreen special edition version of Underworld: Evolution
22880	12.792	23.71	0.3333333432674408	3	 (uhh) And in this (stutter) movie she has to fight a new group of (uhh) vampire werewolf hybrids which are trying to take over the world
22880	10.178	13.024	0.0	2	 In which she plays a vampire
22880	26.79	37.119	-1.0	5	 (uhh) on the DVD the best (uhh) comment they can get is explosive entertainment from someone at FoxTV so they know, (uhh) wasn't that well received
22880	23.977	26.364	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) Movie wasn't that great
22880	39.342	43.245	2.3333332538604736	7	 She's super hot and you'll enjoy the movie for that aspect
22880	36.488	39.953	1.3333333730697632	6	 But Kate Beckinsale looks fantastic in this movie
22880	48.9	54.21	0.0	9	 A few documentaries about (stutter) how the visual effects were made, how the stunts were made
22880	42.944	49.441	1.0	8	 (uhh) In terms of the DVD features it does have (stutter) a few special features (uhh) directors and filmmakers commentary
229090	140.712	143.517	-0.6666666865348816	20	 You know, watching Mystery Science Theater is bad enough
229090	144.313	152.068	-1.0	21	 (uhh) This version's even worse, it's just this long sequences of nothing and (umm) I don't know what they were thinking when they made this
229090	151.258	155.8	-1.0	22	 (uhh) It was made by a fertilizer salesman so take that for what it's worth
229090	4.621	7.826	-2.6666667461395264	1	 Quite possibly the worst movie ever made
229090	0.0	5.411	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk about Manos: The Hands of Fate
229090	13.91	16.516	-0.6666666865348816	3	 It is, it is (stutter) like sour milk
229090	8.412	14.91	-3.0	2	 I think it's a great candidate for it (umm) because it is generally so bad that it cannot be enjoyed
229090	20.944	28.279	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) Manos I think is a better candidate for the title than, say, Plan Nine From Outer Space which you can actually watch and enjoy
229090	15.636	19.469	-1.6666666269302368	4	 No matter which way you swirl it in your mouth it's just, it's just (stutter) awful
229090	39.921	41.819	-0.6666666865348816	7	 (umm) He's clearly demented
229090	28.217	40.192	-1.6666666269302368	6	 Manos is nearly unwatchable and I think the only, the only decent excuse for watching it is either watching the episode of Mystery Science Theater or being Quentin Tarantino (stutter) and enjoying it for some reason
229090	51.863	72.399	0.0	9	 (uhh) There there's (stutter) a guy called the master who's played by this (uhh) menacing fellow here, who played a trucker kind of (umm) who (uhh) owns a house and (umm) a very strange satyr named (uhh) named (uhh) Torgo takes care of it for him
229090	43.822	52.554	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) Manos is (umm) The story about some (uhh) it doesn't make any sense
229090	79.112	84.781	-0.3333333432674408	11	 (umm) Incidentally the guy who played Torgo killed himself a few months after the film was released
229090	71.399	79.453	-0.6666666865348816	10	 You can't really tell that Torgo's a satyr because you don't see his hooves so he just looks like a guy with very large knees and walks funny
229090	91.603	99.737	-1.3333333730697632	13	 (umm) A a (stutter) vacationing family runs across this house, basically (umm) fall under this spell, this strange cult that owns the, I don't know
229090	85.487	89.4	0.0	12	 (uhh) Family members and friends believe it was unrelated but I'm not so sure
229090	105.851	118.684	-2.6666667461395264	15	 (umm) Which of course is the intent seeing as it is a horror movie, yet (uhh) the creepiness just kind of adds to the badness of it somehow and (uhh) it it (stutter) overall it's a very unlikable {sigh} movie
229090	98.927	105.384	-2.3333332538604736	14	 It doesn't make any sense, it's ridiculous, it's hilarious and yet a little creepy at the same time
229090	122.902	128.881	2.6666667461395264	17	 (umm) If you just go online and read about this movie it's it's (stutter) quite interesting and hilarious how it came to be
229090	117.684	122.974	1.0	16	 Although the lore about it is (umm) is fantastic
229090	137.449	141.582	-1.3333333730697632	19	 And it's even more unbearable to watch this uncut version
229090	130.046	137.371	-1.6666666269302368	18	 (umm) And (uhh) that's really the only good thing about it is the sort of cult following that is has, the movie itself is just awful
229903	6.347	13.144	0.0	1	 This movie like the previous two Rush Hour movies stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker
229903	0.0	4.763	0.0	0	Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD movie Rush Hour Three
229903	15.915	30.824	0.0	3	 (umm) They're after a Chinese mastermind, there's (uhh) lots of action in this movie (umm) I did not find this Rush Hour Three to be as funny as the other two Rush Hour movies
229903	12.573	16.237	0.0	2	 This one actually takes place in Paris
229903	39.771	53.622	-2.6666667461395264	5	 (umm) If you are just (umm) (uhh) diehard fan of the Rush Hour series and just wanna see what happens next then that's probably the only person that I would recommend this DVD to
229903	29.854	39.584	-1.6666666269302368	4	 I really think they should've stopped at the first one because in my opinion they kind of got progressively worse after the first one
229903	53.51	63.739	-2.6666667461395264	6	 (uhh) (umm) Otherwise I just really wouldn't waste your time, it just did not measure up to the first two movies at all (umm) (uhh) especially the first one
229967	77.385	80.511	-2.0	10	 But if not then don't waste your time
229967	1.288	5.252	0.0	1	 Today I'm reviewing the DVD movie Sweet November
229967	0.0	1.341	0.0	0	Hi
229967	9.24	22.363	0.0	3	 It stars Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, and Charlize Theron plays a woman who just kind of wants to escape through life, escape to relationships, not having any strings attached
229967	5.309	10.19	0.3333333432674408	2	 This movie is a romantic movie
229967	36.249	40.302	-1.6666666269302368	5	 I really didn't enjoy it that much
229967	22.42	37.219	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) So she invites men into her life for one month only and Keanu Reeves just happens to be her November man and (umm) well it's kind a cheesy romantic movie
229967	55.226	59.538	-1.0	7	 (umm) It it's (stutter) just really, really predictable
229967	40.35	55.537	-2.0	6	 (umm) A lot of parts of it were very predictable and (umm) I for the most part like romantic movies, but this one I just thought it was really a little bit too cheesy
229967	70.95	78.366	-0.3333333432674408	9	 So (umm) if you're a real sap and really like romantic movies, any kind, then check it out
229967	58.538	71.771	-1.3333333730697632	8	 You can't, I mean, like most romantic movies (umm) not really a lot to (umm) the plot and I just really didn't enjoy it that much
230252	64.225	69.216	-1.0	11	 Not really looking for you know, very well done movie
230252	59.536	64.886	1.0	10	 But it was you know, an entertaining horror movie if you're just looking to have a good time
230252	70.391	73.666	-1.0	13	 I'm personally gonna give it a two out of five
230252	68.705	71.391	0.3333333432674408	12	 I guess this movie will do
230252	73.504	77.098	-2.0	14	 I don't think it ever deserves more than that
230252	3.543	8.913	0.0	1	 This is the sequel to Alien Versus Predator which came out two years ago
230252	0.0	4.304	0.0	0	Hi I'm here reviewing Aliens versus Predator: Requiem
230252	15.736	18.581	0.0	3	 (uhh) There were a lot of frightening parts
230252	9.759	15.868	1.6666666269302368	2	 (umm) This movie, it was, I, it was a pretty good horror movie
230252	22.68	28.908	-0.6666666865348816	5	 (uhh) I felt like it's not doing justice to the original Alien, the original Predator movies
230252	18.11	23.061	-1.3333333730697632	4	 I know but this whole alien versus predator thing is just way too commercialized
230252	39.282	53.702	-1.3333333730697632	7	 And (uhh) couple of new things in this movie, there's a pred-alien combination predator alien that's kind of a, cheesy and expected (uhh) you know, next step for this franchise
230252	29.834	38.885	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) In this movie, a predator lands on earth to kill the aliens that escape from the ship at the end of the last movie
230252	56.303	60.017	-1.3333333730697632	9	 I don't like the whole Alien versus Predator franchise
230252	53.37	56.535	-1.0	8	 And some of you were just kind of cheesy
231025	36.359	41.14	-1.3333333730697632	11	 She's just not sort of a romantic heroine in my mind
231025	34.752	36.491	-0.3333333432674408	10	 Let me be frank
231025	56.443	75.622	0.3333333432674408	13	 And you know, it's a sweet idea and it was definitely worth seeing if you're looking for something (umm) kind of schmaltzy {laughter} but (umm) I'd recommend waiting for the DVD or (umm) yeah
231025	41.697	57.114	1.0	12	 (umm) It's a sort of sickly sweet love story about a a (stutter) woman whose (umm) husband dies and leaves her letters that (umm) try to help her get back into life
231025	77.186	85.878	-1.0	15	 And she just doesn't have the (uhh) sort of, romantic heroine look
231025	75.161	77.976	-2.0	14	 Definitely it's more of a renter
231025	91.174	97.412	-2.0	17	 So not a highly recommended movie, probably like a two star movie
231025	85.477	91.935	-0.6666666865348816	16	 I found her kind of (uhh) harsh and (umm) it just didn't capitalize on her strengths
231025	97.28	104.197	-0.6666666865348816	18	 {laughter} (umm) Definitely (uhh) you know if you got nothing better to do it's fine but not a fantastic movie
231025	2.416	4.473	0.0	1	 Time to review a movie
231025	0.001	3.156	1.6666666269302368	0	Hi, (umm) so Expo
231025	15.307	20.128	-0.6666666865348816	3	 I didn't see the boxing movie cuz (uhh) I just heard that it was too grim
231025	5.778	15.987	2.6666667461395264	2	 (umm) I really like Hilary Swank, I think she's a great actress and I think she was fantastic in Boys Don't Cry
231025	27.708	29.886	0.0	5	 So I went to see P
231025	19.447	28.489	2.3333332538604736	4	 But (umm) I thought she was tremendous in Boys Don't Cry, so I really wanted to see what she was up to
231025	29.155	30.784	1.0	7	 I Love You
231025	33.934	35.383	-0.3333333432674408	9	 Alright
231025	31.54	34.236	0.0	8	 Here's my little thingy
233171	9.32	21.066	-1.6666666269302368	1	 (uhh) Now this movie is a sequel of the earlier movie and (uhh) sorry to say but it's not as good in fact it's terrible and I rate this movie two on five to start with
233171	0.54	9.322	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi my name is Anesh and today I'm reviewing the movie Aliens versus Predators requiem which is currently running in theaters nationwide
233171	38.644	44.014	-1.0	3	 (uhh) But none as good as the one that would and you know, in the earlier movie
233171	20.814	38.915	0.0	2	 (uhh) The movie is the same you know there's this war between the predators and aliens there's only one predator (uhh) left on earth and you know he contacts the base station and then ask for backup (uhh) there lots of (uhh) you know, action sequences
233171	47.444	63.459	-1.0	5	 (uhh) The same kind of action and you you (stutter) would not expect them to come up with something new something different that would actually gather the attention of the audience make it more interesting but (uhh) nothing that you can see in this movie
233171	43.014	47.645	-1.0	4	 This one is you know disappointing the scenes repeat again and again
233171	79.241	81.808	-2.0	7	 (umm) Totally not recommended at all
233171	63.687	78.675	-2.6666667461395264	6	 (umm) Really disappointing, (uhh) two on five again and (uhh) you know if you're really big (stutter) fan of sci-fi these kind of movies go to theaters otherwise you know just wait and maybe watch it on DVD later on
233356	77.356	79.353	0.0	11	 But that's about it
233356	65.024	78.146	-1.0	10	 So (uhh) I'll give it one star for (uhh), actually half a star for their hair, (uhh) everybody had good hair, and (uhh) half a star for (uhh) Katie Holmes' dancing
233356	1.857	5.481	0.6666666865348816	1	 So I think I finally hit the wall, movie wise
233356	0.8	2.408	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi expo
233356	22.839	26.733	1.6666666269302368	3	 Okay, here are the good things I can say about this movie
233356	5.649	23.54	1.3333333730697632	2	" (umm) I (stutter) you know, I was thinking ""okay, Diane Keaton, (uhh) (uhh) Queen Latifah, Katie Holmes, how bad can it be?"" You know? Diane Keaton's awesome, and Queen Latifah is totally cool, and Katie Holmes she's cute"
233356	33.954	39.135	0.0	5	 I wish I could take credit for that comment but (uhh) somebody else said it
233356	27.539	34.475	1.6666666269302368	4	 (uhh) They all had really good hair and (uhh) it was nice to see Katie Holmes with a man her own age {laugh}
233356	45.199	48.404	-2.6666667461395264	7	 Really not a great movie
233356	39.122	43.595	0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) So anyway (umm) I'm talking about Mad Money
233356	57.481	65.804	-2.3333332538604736	9	 So (uhh) I can't begin to tell you how bad I think this movie is, and I'm really sorry because it actually could have been kind of good
233356	47.713	58.481	-0.3333333432674408	8	 In fact I think it speaks to the moral bankruptcy of our culture {laugh} and my own bad taste that I would go to this movie
233366	0.65	6.808	-0.3333333432674408	1	 Today I'd like review Bee Movie, which is an animated movie currently in theaters
233366	0.311	1.65	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
233366	19.896	29.078	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) But this is an okay movie but overall I just found it to be not very interesting, like I didn't see the point
233366	6.487	18.951	0.3333333432674408	2	 This is (uhh) written by Jerry Seinfeld and it stars Jerry Seinfeld and Rene Zellweger, or the voices of them cause it's computer animated
233366	39.921	57.812	-1.0	5	 (umm) I love, you know, Toy Story and Ratatouille and most of the Pixar movies (umm) but this was just really generic and maybe it had a few funny one liners and Seinfeld was his normal self, but (uhh) overall I just didn't see the point
233366	28.078	39.125	-1.3333333730697632	4	 It wasn't any different than all those other animated movies about bugs or toys or stuff like that
233366	68.426	73.676	-1.6666666269302368	7	 So I give Bee Movie a four out of ten
233366	57.012	69.426	-2.0	6	 I mean besides the good animation (umm) I really can't recommend it unless you have little kids cause they'd probably enjoy it, but other than that not a great movie

233389	37.267	63.829	0.6666666865348816	4	 (uhh) The Jean Harlow character (uhh) (stutter) seduces (uhh) the young innocent (uhh) crusading (uhh) newspaper reporter and (uhh) also in this movie we have the young Loretta Young who is incredibly beautiful and our intrepid reporter for whatever reason ignores her
233389	82.025	104.596	2.0	6	 (umm) big west was before my time and I can see her appeal and what she meant to the audience and why men were intrigued by her (uhh) and as far as Frank Frank (stutter) Capra goes, he has made much better movies after Platinum Blonde

236399	8.801	13.014	-2.0	2	 (umm) I thought this was not all that great
236399	17.661	21.515	0.3333333432674408	5	 And don't get me wrong, there's some funny parts in it
236399	15.466	18.611	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) Especially with Cedric the Entertainer
236399	28.267	33.647	0.0	7	 (umm) It's rated PG-thirteen for crude humor, so forth
236399	21.083	27.92	-1.0	6	 But overall, I think my expectations of it really were a lot higher than what I got
236399	37.466	42.228	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) I think towards the end I was just really hoping it would end pretty quick
236399	33.675	37.927	0.0	8	 (umm) And it's ninety-six minutes long
236696	45.877	48.633	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (umm) Who knows? Somebody might like it
236696	35.002	44.732	-2.0	10	 (umm) I'm actually kind of sad I own this movie but anyway (umm) it's ninety minutes long, it's rated PG
236696	50.576	54.27	-2.6666667461395264	13	 I'd probably give this one a one, if that

236696	25.294	29.517	0.0	6	 Okay, that's all I'll say, but that's all that matters
236696	31.23	33.877	-2.0	9	 It's not funny, it's not interesting
236696	30.293	32.23	-2.3333332538604736	8	 It's actually terrible
238023	103.337	105.953	-1.6666666269302368	24	 He's (uhh) not charismatic at all
238023	105.372	108.008	0.0	25	 The total opposite of, of (stutter) Christian Bale
238023	107.577	109.116	-1.3333333730697632	26	 He's completely uncharismatic
238023	108.116	110.732	-2.0	27	 He's so bland and uninteresting
238023	90.386	94.459	-1.0	20	 (umm) I don't really know what it was that disturbed me so much about this movie
238023	93.459	95.337	-2.3333332538604736	21	 It just annoyed me
238023	94.417	102.042	-0.6666666865348816	22	 Part of it was (umm) the lead, James Van Der Beek, (umm) who plays Patrick Bateman's (uhh) brother
238023	102.409	104.047	-3.0	23	 (uhh) It's just awful
238023	110.011	111.75	-1.3333333730697632	28	 Not a good actor
238023	111.927	115.671	-1.6666666269302368	29	 Kind of (umm) upsetting, not interesting at all

238023	17.332	21.694	1.6666666269302368	7	 I think it's, I think it's (stutter) very good and (umm) There
238023	16.145	18.332	1.3333333730697632	6	 And I like American Psycho a lot
238023	22.301	24.598	-2.3333332538604736	9	 Well, I could probably hate it more
238023	20.694	23.121	-1.6666666269302368	8	 I could not hate this movie any more
238023	162.981	166.316	-0.6666666865348816	38	 It's a totally different creature and you might not like it at all
238023	27.2	29.267	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (uhh) because my head will explode
238023	23.698	27.282	-1.6666666269302368	10	 But (umm) I don't want to think about how I could hate it anymore
238023	33.775	47.805	-1.0	13	 Well, I'd like a movie that isn't completely (uhh) disturbing, disjointed, uninteresting, doesn't engage me with the characters, (umm) doesn't really have much of a plot, and just kind of meanders around
238023	30.432	34.425	0.0	12	 (umm) Apparently, Time Magazine asked, What more could you want in a movie
238023	65.253	67.221	-1.3333333730697632	15	 I don't like that
238023	47.354	65.744	-1.6666666269302368	14	 This supposed, you know, world of, of, of (stutter) college, that isn't really like any actual college environment anywhere and I hate that I hate that (stutter) stories that we're supposed to accept as like a dead on satire of how we live, when they're completely off base
238023	75.929	80.231	0.0	17	 I don't know if that's how he perceived it or if that's how he believes it is now
238023	66.221	76.48	0.0	16	 And (umm) I don't know if it's how these how these (stutter) writers, Bret Easton Ellis, if that how he perceived, perceived, I don't know, I assume he went to college
238023	84.859	88.752	-0.6666666865348816	19	 I love American Psycho, and I'm certainly not going to try Rules of Attraction
238023	81.436	85.859	-1.6666666269302368	18	 (umm) I don't know how much of course it was all through the movie, because I couldn't get through it
238023	126.085	137.79	-1.3333333730697632	31	 (uhh) Maybe maybe (stutter) I'm just missing that, but I felt like the behavior of these characters was completely out of touch with reality and that I don't find that interesting or attractive in a movie
238023	116.517	126.297	-2.0	30	 (umm) And maybe maybe (stutter) I suppose it's possible, that the whole point of (umm) this movie is just to unsettle you and make you not like it
238023	154.291	163.422	-2.3333332538604736	37	 (umm) This, this (stutter) just really (uhh) I just, I beg you don't go into it like I did, thinking Oh I loved American Psycho, I'm gonna love this
238023	150.679	153.485	0.0	36	 I'm going to have to have a talk with him about that
238023	148.663	151.679	0.6666666865348816	35	 Apparently my boyfriend liked it enough to buy it

238023	144.473	148.546	-1.3333333730697632	33	 (umm) But I can't quite conceive of liking it
238023	137.299	143.348	1.0	32	 So (umm) (uhh) you may like Rules of Attraction
238039	71.379	79.104	-1.3333333730697632	11	 So that's all I have to say for it there's a lot of one liners and they absolutely hit flat bottom they're not funny
238039	64.944	71.88	-0.6666666865348816	10	 There are so many actors and actresses in this it could have been so good, it could have been like Ratatouille but it wasn't
238039	78.732	85.25	-1.0	12	 So this is not a kid's movie, it's an adults movie, it's a Jerry Seinfeld movie Jerry could do better

238039	36.568	41.37	0.0	6	 He (uhh) is the voice of, (uhh) is Jerry Seinfeld
238039	63.557	65.595	1.0	9	 I thought that was kind of cute
238039	43.712	64.208	0.0	8	 And so he actually talks to a florist, she saves his life and therefore she helps him find a lawyer who (uhh) basically he's going to sue humans for stealing his bee honey and from then on people are worried, the bees are worried that he's going to with people and his mother at at least (stutter) talking to the woman, that he's talking to his bee life or bee-ish
238060	82.853	86.248	-2.0	11	 It's, there's nothing about it that's good
238060	81.217	83.853	-2.0	10	 (uhh) It's sickening, it's a sicko movie
238060	89.468	104.097	-0.3333333432674408	13	 Second of all (umm) (uhh) Jennifer Marsh, or Diane Lane, comes across a website of I believe it was called (uhh) kill with me dot com and it actually shows a starving cat
238060	86.475	90.119	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (uhh) It's, the movie, first of all the plot is not plausible
238060	104.504	114.483	-2.0	15	 It shows another scene where a person is bound and it has the the (stutter) person's name branded on the person's chest, and it just gets worse and worse and worse
238060	103.157	105.504	0.0	14	 The cat has actually been starved to death

238100	27.239	40.272	0.0	4	 It's a spoof movie sort of like a Scary Movie (umm) and (uhh) the Airplane movies, where just it's a lot of (uhh) fast paced quick one liners and things along that nature

238100	43.413	46.598	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (umm) Most of the jokes were pretty predictable

239235	56.513	63.839	2.0	11	 And (uhh) But really the best part is the classic Beauty and the Beast movie
239235	51.973	56.914	1.0	10	 (uhh) You do get a lot of extra stuff by buying the platinum edition
239235	65.283	73.387	2.3333332538604736	13	 It's wonderful animation and the cutest characters and (uhh) really really good music

241638	25.912	34.016	-0.3333333432674408	3	 (uhh) I thought it would be more along the lines of maybe a Shrek where it would be a movie that the kids would like but the adults would like too
241638	22.211	25.695	-1.6666666269302368	2	 (uhh) overall I was very disappointed in the movie

241638	33.974	42.896	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) however it's much more for the kids which was really surprising (uhh) considering it was Jerry Seinfeld (uhh) Chris Rock

24202	57.341	64.836	-2.6666667461395264	11	 So you know, if you're looking for a movie to see, then do not see this one, because it will disappoint and you will lose your money
24202	52.592	57.593	-2.6666667461395264	10	 That's how bad I thought it was and (stutter) apparently other people thought it was too
24202	5.1	14.99	0.0	1	 Now I was a, I'm a fan of fantasy movies so when I saw some of the commercials for this I thought alright, I'm gonna go check this movie out
24202	0.0	5.601	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I am reviewing the movie Eragon, which is currently in theaters
24202	21.812	25.396	-3.0	3	 It was a horrible ripoff of The Lord of The Rings
24202	14.848	21.884	-2.3333332538604736	2	 If you you're (stutter) a fan of fantasy movies, or any type of movie for that matter do not see this movie
24202	27.619	33.817	-2.6666667461395264	5	 The dialogues were horrible, performances were (stutter) awful if you ask me
24202	26.242	28.619	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) It was just a mess
24202	41.028	45.909	-2.6666667461395264	7	 (umm) I'd say about halfway through the movie, I had enough, I had to walk out
24202	34.772	41.04	-3.0	6	 (umm) I thought, I don't understand how some people could approve this movie and put it out for production, it was just awful
24202	48.371	53.592	-2.0	9	 So you know, even little kids with parents were leaving this movie
24202	45.588	48.833	-2.0	8	 People before me were walking out of this movie
243338	117.454	121.138	-1.6666666269302368	24	 So, I don't know, Vince Vaughn you disappointed me
243338	120.138	123.273	-3.0	25	 But the movie's not that great, okay
243338	122.273	123.852	-2.6666667461395264	26	 It's terrible
243338	98.328	101.234	-0.6666666865348816	20	 I don't even know what I was saying when it was a decent movie
243338	100.234	102.371	-2.3333332538604736	21	 It's really stupid
243338	102.039	115.751	-1.3333333730697632	22	 In fact just thinking about it just makes me mad because I went to go see it and Vince Vaughn really disappointed me and I hope his next movie's not like that cause if his next movie's like that, I'm gonna be disappointed and his Wild Wild West show just came out recently and I'm not gonna go see it because of that
243338	114.751	117.896	-2.3333332538604736	23	 You disappointed me and I don't know, you know
243338	4.571	10.809	0.0	1	 (umm) It's still in theaters, I don't know if it is or not and (umm) it stars Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti
243338	0.52	4.793	0.0	0	Expo I'm gonna talk about the movie Fred Claus
243338	13.551	16.157	0.0	3	 He usually, Vince Vaughn's a hilarious guy
243338	11.725	14.551	-2.6666667461395264	2	 Vince Vaughn you really disappointed me with this one
243338	17.681	22.961	-1.6666666269302368	5	 And that's why I guarantee a lot of people went to see the movie cause they thought Vince Vaughn was in it, it's probably funny
243338	15.496	18.681	0.0	4	 In Fact, that's why I went to see the movie, cause Vince Vaughn's in it
243338	23.608	25.655	-2.0	7	 But it's really not that funny
243338	21.961	24.199	-0.3333333432674408	6	 It's probably a hilarious movie
243338	26.292	31.392	-1.3333333730697632	9	 I mean, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it is it is (stutter) not that great of a movie at all
243338	24.655	27.292	-2.3333332538604736	8	 It's really kind of a stupid movie
243338	33.455	35.732	-1.3333333730697632	11	 I wouldn't recommend paying full price
243338	30.761	34.455	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (uhh) I wouldn't recommend seeing it (uhh) in theaters
243338	38.474	43.615	-1.3333333730697632	13	 But if you didn't see it at all in general, no, no (stutter) harm no foul
243338	34.732	39.474	-0.3333333432674408	12	 If you wanted to wait until it came out on DVD I I (stutter) would I suggest doing that
243338	44.65	67.61	-0.6666666865348816	15	 So basic plot, (umm) Vince Vaughn is, his name's Fred, and he is the older brother of Santa Claus and they have the whole family thing you know cause he's brothers and they got parents and then this whole dramatic structure of how their in a relationship with family and how Fred's supposed to be more like (stutter) Santa Claus, which is his brother
243338	42.615	45.221	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I mean seriously, it's not that great of a movie
243338	70.541	96.285	-2.3333332538604736	17	 So It's this whole family kind of comedy thing about how they how they don't get along and then (stutter) the main plots really about how you know Fred (stutters) he should be more like his brother and how but Fred kinda keeps messing up with his brother and like he marks everybody on the on the (stutter), he believes everybody shouldn't get a president present (stutter) on Christmas and I mean, it's just it's just crazy stupid
243338	67.219	71.541	0.0	16	 But his his name's Nick, obviously you know Saint Nicholas, his name's Nick
243338	97.051	99.328	-2.6666667461395264	19	 It's really not that funny
243338	95.285	97.891	-2.6666667461395264	18	 It's just stupid, okay
243341	83.192	90.478	-2.0	24	 I mean seriously just drop these parodying of movies, just a whole bunch of recent movies they parodied and (uhh) you know, who was in it
243341	90.566	95.517	-0.6666666865348816	25	 (stutter) It wasn't Pamela Anderson it was, I don't know what her name even was
243341	94.886	97.991	0.0	26	 (uhh) Carmen Elektra, (stutter) that's who's in it
243341	97.26	103.309	-2.3333332538604736	27	 Just made me so mad, seriously, just stop making these movies, that's all I gotta just to say
243341	67.059	70.444	-2.0	20	 Giving this review just makes me so mad about this movie, so
243341	70.341	77.697	-0.6666666865348816	21	 I mean here is some movies they did: Three Hundred, Chainsaw Massacre, Spider-Man Three, they parodied Britney Spears
243341	76.996	81.399	-2.3333332538604736	22	 You know, they just did all this stupid stuff
243341	80.738	83.584	-1.6666666269302368	23	 What can I say I mean that's really about it
243341	102.309	106.152	-3.0	28	 I give it like, zero out of five if I could
243341	105.372	107.629	-2.6666667461395264	29	 Like I give it negative
243341	4.471	8.854	0.0	1	 I'm gonna do a review here on Meet the Spartans
243341	0.79	5.471	-1.0	0	Expo, I'm gonna get really insane about this one
243341	15.057	17.234	-2.6666667461395264	3	 Who keeps making these movies
243341	7.854	15.399	-2.6666667461395264	2	 Somebody kill me now, who keeps making these movies? Seriously
243341	18.06	19.918	-2.6666667461395264	5	 Don't go see it
243341	16.534	18.332	-3.0	4	 They're terrible
243341	25.653	28.239	-2.6666667461395264	7	 Don't go see it, it's not worth it
243341	19.337	26.204	-1.3333333730697632	6	 If somebody comes up to you and is like, hey, you wanna go see the movie for free? I'll pay you to go see the movie
243341	29.584	31.851	-1.6666666269302368	9	 You'll seriously question living
243341	27.429	30.235	-2.6666667461395264	8	 It's not worth it, you'll question life
243341	33.585	38.935	-2.3333332538604736	11	 Okay it's another one of these movies that parodies movies and it's just stupid
243341	31.23	34.385	-3.0	10	 Seriously it's terrible, it is terrible
243341	46.127	50.11	-0.6666666865348816	13	 And this is supposedly one of the sequels to like epic movie I think
243341	38.175	46.907	-2.3333332538604736	12	 You think they would have learned this after all the scary movies, what they made like four already? They made four Scary Movies and made this epic, epic (stutter) movie, they made this date movie
243341	54.657	57.762	-3.0	15	 Just, just stop making the movies
243341	49.469	55.078	-1.6666666269302368	14	 But they had to be, call it, they had to call it Meet the Spartans because every movie did so bad
243341	58.039	62.781	-2.6666667461395264	17	 Okay come up with something more original than copying other people or trying to make fun of them
243341	56.982	58.74	-3.0	16	 Just stop making them
243341	63.956	68.019	-1.6666666269302368	19	 So, it just made me so mad just even talking about this
243341	62.23	64.288	-2.0	18	 It's just stupid
243341	109.991	111.77	-2.3333332538604736	31	 Don't waste your life
243341	107.288	110.922	-3.0	30	 Okay, I give it negative it's terrible, it's all I gotta say
243341	130.565	133.161	-2.0	36	 Just be like, go to your room, seriously
243341	128.13	130.986	-1.3333333730697632	35	 Just because they were even thinking about going to see it
243341	124.987	128.761	-1.0	34	 Like you are grounded, you go to your room for the rest of the night
243341	113.174	125.728	-1.6666666269302368	33	 Don't, if your kids like, if if (stutter) you're a parent and your kid's like hey, oh well I'm gonna go out with (uhh) my friends we're about to go see (uhh) they're like ten years old it doesn't even matter, but like I'm about to go see it just be like no, you're grounded
243341	111.119	113.875	-2.3333332538604736	32	 Don't see it on DVD when it comes out
244180	54.498	63.19	-1.3333333730697632	20	 So, I guess it has those things going for it but, overall I was definitely not impressed (umm) and I really wouldn't recommend it
244180	63.327	65.505	-1.6666666269302368	21	 I'd just read the book instead
244180	3.523	6.259	0.0	1	 I saw it in theaters a few weeks ago
244180	0.0	4.144	1.0	0	Hey guys, I'm going to be reviewing The Golden Compass today
244180	7.325	14.441	-2.6666667461395264	3	 I read it several times, it's one of my favorite books in the whole world and the movie is just terrible
244180	6.327	8.055	0.0	2	 (umm) I read the book
244180	17.651	20.876	0.0	5	 (umm) They changed things in the plot around
244180	13.76	17.534	-2.0	4	 It really doesn't do the book justice at all
244180	20.904	23.71	-1.0	7	 They took away really important facts
244180	19.876	21.904	0.3333333432674408	6	 They added new things
244180	24.176	26.663	-1.6666666269302368	9	 It was just not good
244180	22.76	25.176	-0.6666666865348816	8	 They ended it (stutter) early
244180	30.173	32.979	0.3333333432674408	11	 (umm) It did have some things going for it I guess
244180	26.371	30.285	-1.6666666269302368	10	 I mean, not even close to how good the book was
244180	33.226	37.259	1.3333333730697632	13	 Nicole Kidman was a, she was a good Misses Colter
244180	31.979	34.226	1.3333333730697632	12	 The acting was pretty good
244180	39.631	42.786	-0.3333333432674408	15	 Misses Colter was supposed to have black hair but that's okay
244180	36.259	40.112	0.3333333432674408	14	 She was pretty much how I imagined her, except for the blond hair
244180	45.378	49.99	0.3333333432674408	17	 She wasn't exactly how I had pictured Lyra as being but she was okay
244180	43.782	46.378	-0.3333333432674408	16	 (umm) The lead actress was okay I guess
244180	50.467	54.719	1.3333333730697632	19	 And they did pretty good special effects with the demons and things like that
244180	48.99	51.028	2.0	18	 She did a decent job
244261	154.64	157.246	0.6666666865348816	24	 Some big names in it as well
244261	157.015	158.394	0.0	25	 (umm) But yeah

244261	22.57	27.102	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) And you gotta watch the movie to see that cause a lot of it comes toward the end of the movie
244261	17.482	22.443	1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) It's a good movie, it's really weird and twisted but it's a great movie

244261	26.102	42.467	0.3333333432674408	6	 But (umm) yeah basically it's about this this (stutter) guy that he's really into like, you know, got the ghost sightings and stuff so he'll go, he'll stay places where they say they've seen them and just to check if anything's really going on, stuff like that
244261	48.062	57.633	-0.3333333432674408	9	 But (umm) yeah, basically (umm) he hears about this place and he's kind of famous, not really famous, but so so

244623	34.473	37.189	-1.6666666269302368	8	 Yeah, it's not that good
244623	41.178	46.019	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (uhh) The acting's okay but the snakes are so ridiculously fake
244623	38.913	41.39	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (umm) Kind of dumb everything
244623	49.01	51.367	-1.3333333730697632	13	 I think they're so fake
244623	45.698	50.01	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Like I don't know I've seen other people say oh they're so real
244623	52.312	58.75	0.0	15	 But (umm) basically I mean that's what the movie's about obviously
244623	50.367	52.913	-1.0	14	 Like you can even tell it's fake
244623	67.259	76.799	0.0	17	 So yeah it's it's (stutter) pretty adventurous and (umm) Yeah, so I don't know, It's a little different
244623	57.75	68.259	-1.0	16	 There's (umm) passenger plane and (umm) somehow snakes get loaded on and then they just go crazy
244623	77.635	80.022	0.0	19	 So here's a little scene
244623	108.026	110.413	-0.6666666865348816	32	977} Yeah so {movie_110
244623	128.609	130.477	-0.3333333432674408	37	 So two out of five
244623	125.546	129.42	1.3333333730697632	36	 So go check it out if you want something funny to laugh at
244623	122.453	124.71	0.0	35	 There's Snakes on a Plane
244623	111.308	122.854	-0.6666666865348816	34	525} But yeah that's a little clip of it and (uhh) It's not, may give little kids nightmares so I don't really recommend it but
244623	75.799	78.146	-1.3333333730697632	18	 I'm gonna give it two out of five
244817	8.342	11.797	0.0	1	 (uhh) This is an unusual movie
244817	0.0	7.786	-0.6666666865348816	0	Hello and welcome to my review of (uhh) Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
244817	18.25	21.415	1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh) He tends to play the roles well
244817	10.797	18.152	-2.0	2	 Johnny Depp seems to like to do these weird characters and just weird movies
244817	28.507	33.986	-0.6666666865348816	5	 (uhh) It it's (stutter) kind of an unusual movie in the fact that it's a musical
244817	21.862	28.02	-0.6666666865348816	4	 I will say that Johnny Depp again does a good job in this movie although I did not like this movie
244817	48.501	65.924	-1.3333333730697632	7	 I don't know, I just I didn't think the movie was, you know, it was well acted, Johnny Depp, you know, he just plays a good weird guy but other than that (uhh) the story, you know, you may be familiar with the story
244817	33.595	48.523	-1.6666666269302368	6	 So first off I'm not big into musicals myself, you may be, so you may like it a little better but (uhh) actually my parents love musicals and they hated this movie as well, is what they told me so (uhh)
244817	78.064	85.0	-2.0	9	 But it just, the movie didn't do it for me and (uhh) I certainly would not waste my money going to see it in the theater
244817	65.453	77.927	0.0	8	 A guy, you know, tries to get revenge (uhh) and kills a lot of people (uhh) as a barber because he's got a mess of a willing victim sitting there in his chair so (umm)
244829	63.727	66.163	1.6666666269302368	10	 The acting was actually pretty good
244829	2.087	14.93	0.3333333432674408	1	 It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about the film currently in theaters The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richard, and Daniel Craig, (uhh) the list goes on
244829	0.41	2.947	1.3333333730697632	0	Hello expotv land
244829	22.74	27.79	1.0	3	 It was, it was (stutter) kind of an intriguing (umm) idea kind of thing
244829	14.249	23.65	-0.3333333432674408	2	 But I think, well I haven't read the books, but the movie didn't, was really not that intriguing
244829	35.511	39.943	-0.6666666865348816	5	 It really wasn't its own entity, so to speak
244829	27.958	36.431	-2.0	4	 (umm) The soul of a person connected to a animal but I feel like the movie did not pull anything off
244829	46.296	50.519	-1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) It really wasn't that engaging and it just kept going on and on
244829	38.943	45.81	-1.3333333730697632	6	 It didn't really, it it (stutter) seemed to rely too much on the viewer's background knowledge of the book
244829	50.796	64.068	-1.3333333730697632	9	 It seemed like more than two hours and (umm) probably it was (stutter) unknown to me it was only the first part of a series of movies so it didn't really have any resolution at all
244829	49.519	51.487	-0.6666666865348816	8	 It was a long movie
244836	67.747	82.207	-2.0	10	 But it was just overall pretty disappointing movie because it got such high appraisal from some people, and I just think that it's just too corny and predictable for most viewers who are looking for a, interesting movie
244836	5.808	7.976	0.3333333432674408	1	 (umm) August Rush
244836	0.101	6.22	0.0	0	Hi Expo TV Land, it's me Danny Erickson here to talk to you about a movie currently in theaters
244836	17.821	28.698	-2.0	3	 (umm) This movie, (stutter) it was recommended to me by some people who I thought had a good opinion, but I guess they were wrong because this was really a disappointing movie
244836	7.265	17.384	-1.3333333730697632	2	 This has Freddie Highmore, (stutter) the up and coming young actor, as well as Robin Williams who's consistently disappointing in my opinion
244836	32.298	37.119	1.6666666269302368	5	 I mean, I like the part about, I liked the musical part of the movie
244836	28.297	32.879	-1.6666666269302368	4	 Even as a family movie it's just way too predictable
244836	44.999	53.193	-2.3333332538604736	7	 But, the whole premise of the movie is just, just so cheesy, and it's so predictable the whole movie
244836	36.528	45.999	0.6666666865348816	6	 Because he's a music prodigy and he can create music and just has, is in tune with music and (uhh) in a special way
244836	59.995	68.747	0.3333333432674408	9	 So I just thought it was (Uhh) good performance by Freddie Highmore and a lame performance by Robin Williams
244836	53.51	60.416	-2.0	8	 (umm) twenty minutes in I felt like I knew what was going to happen like every every (stutter) part of the movie
245243	10.049	46.508	2.6666667461395264	1	 Starring Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie MacDowell and (uhh) directed by Harold Ramis who started with Bill Murray and stripes (uhh) seven years before (umm) this is one of my favorite comedies of the last say twenty years it's a very simple premise done extremely well, and the simple premise is that a man gets stuck re-living the same day over and over again until he gets it right (uhh) in this case it's a weather man (uhh) played by Bill Murray who gets stuck in Groundhog Day in Puxatony, Philadelphia or excuse me Puxatony, Pennsylvania (uhh) until he gets the day right
245243	0.77	10.699	2.0	0	Oh Hi Expo TV I am here to review the DVD of (uhh) a great comedy from the early nineties Groundhog Day
245243	68.685	98.19	2.0	3	 (uhh) Chris Elliott does a really nice supporting job in here as the camera man (umm) I would really recommend getting this DVD (uhh) and if you rent it, or buy it, or whatever you do (uhh) You've got to listen to the Harold Ramis commentary track it's very informative, (uhh) very funny tell's you a lot about the movie (umm) little tidbits like they assumed while they're making the movie that (uhh) Bill Murray is is (stutter) stuck in this day for about ten years
245243	47.044	69.127	3.0	2	 (umm) Somehow they found a way to make each new iteration of the day (uhh) different, fresh and it never gets boring in fact (uhh) as you go on you wait more and more to see (uhh) the familiar scenes play out in a different way and that's a lot of that credit goes to the script a lot of that credit goes to Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie Macdowell for keeping things fun
245243	97.49	107.32	0.3333333432674408	4	 So you get a sense of how long this is going on, even though you see maybe fifteen (uhh) versions of the day throughout the movie he's stuck in it much longer so you get a much greater sense of it
245276	59.037	61.045	-2.0	11	 Zero out of five
245276	49.439	59.878	-2.3333332538604736	10	 Who, Dungeons and Dragons shouldn't have been made a, oh man, what's next, like Risk the movie? Okay, so (uhh) time for the rating
245276	62.17	63.439	0.0	13	 Yeah
245276	60.843	62.741	-2.0	12	 Zero out of ten
245276	66.4	72.01	-2.0	15	 (uhh) It's harsh words but it's really not good, I'm I'm (stutter) bummed out I just watched it and wasted my night
245276	62.609	66.353	-3.0	14	 Dungeons and Dragons, don't watch it unless you're an idiot
245276	71.898	74.085	-2.0	16	 Don't watch this movie
245276	5.489	7.826	0.0	1	 It's Dungeons and Dragons on DVD
245276	0.0	6.379	-1.6666666269302368	0	Okay ExpoTv, it's a DVD review it's really bad
245276	10.388	12.565	-2.6666667461395264	3	 It's not good at all
245276	6.826	11.009	-2.6666667461395264	2	 It's like don't watch it
245276	14.439	18.472	-2.3333332538604736	5	 It wasn't entertaining, it wasn't even like the funny kind of bad
245276	12.772	14.69	-2.3333332538604736	4	 I don't know why they made it
245276	31.26	35.892	-2.6666667461395264	7	 But why would you want to watch any of that when the movie is absolutely horrible
245276	19.617	31.342	1.0	6	 I guess for the plus side (umm) it's got two audio commentaries and two documentaries and deleted scenes and (uhh) special effects deconstruction
245276	44.231	50.369	-2.3333332538604736	9	 Marlon Wayans, yeah let's get him in there, he's he's (stutter) great at these serious roles
245276	35.471	43.904	-2.0	8	 So (umm) {noise} how do they finance this, who said, who who (stutter) was like, Dungeons and Dragons that's a good movie
245322	1.328	9.163	0.0	1	 It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to review the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks (uhh) with Jason Lee
245322	0.111	2.328	0.6666666865348816	0	Hey expotv land
245322	38.434	51.137	-2.0	3	 So just really wasn't what I, didn't have the same feel that I hoped that the original TV show had and it's just probably not even that fun of a movie for the family to watch
245322	8.302	39.434	-2.0	2	 This is (uhh) a newer adaptation with computer animation of the old TV show Alvin and the Chipmunks where there's three chipmunks who sing music and perform, become an overnight sensation and if I had the choice I would not watch this movie ever again because it's really cheesy and even cheesier than I thought it would be and it really didn't even, wasn't fun like the original was, the original TV show
245322	53.011	60.017	-2.0	5	 So I would say if you have the choice to go to it, don't go cause it's kind of just a disappointment
245322	50.137	53.302	0.0	4	 Kids, younger kids, don't even relate to that TV show
245322	59.197	62.053	0.3333333432674408	6	 But (uhh) so yeah
245497	10.148	34.395	-1.6666666269302368	1	 Now this is the sequel to the movie Alien Versus Predator which came out a couple years ago and when I watched that movie I was kind of excited because I'm a fan of the Alien movies and the Predator movies and I was very disappointed by that, so I'm not sure why I watched the second one but I was still surprisingly even more disappointed
245497	0.44	10.58	0.3333333432674408	0	Well hello expotv land, it's me Danny Ericson and I'm here to talk to you about the new movie in theaters Alien Versus Predator: Requiem
245497	43.722	46.917	-1.0	3	 I didn't really understand why they were fighting each other
245497	34.882	44.522	-2.0	2	 (umm) It does include the characters the Aliens from the Alien movies and the Predator from the Predators movies but once again it's just pointless seeming
245497	53.041	66.662	-1.0	5	 So if you're into (umm) a lot of gore that's really pointless I guess you'd like this movie but overall I didn't really see a point in watching it because it just didn't seem like there was {laugh} any point to it
245497	46.496	53.293	-0.6666666865348816	4	 It was rated R, (umm) compared to the last one which was rated only PG-thirteen and it had a lot more blood
247382	112.007	115.651	-0.3333333432674408	20	 It's fairly interesting but it's (uhh) nothing spectacular
247382	115.16	118.015	0.0	21	 That's The Hulk on DVD
247382	0.64	6.569	0.3333333432674408	1	 I'm Chris and this is a review of the DVD for the movie The Hulk
247382	0.131	1.311	0.0	0	Hi
247382	17.312	30.145	-1.0	3	 (uhh) I was expecting sort of a (uhh) big screen version of the (uhh) eighties television series (uhh) The Incredible Hulk (uhh) the one that starred (uhh) Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk
247382	7.015	17.723	-1.0	2	 (uhh) This movie came out a couple of years ago and I have to say that it wasn't at all what I expected and I was a little bit (uhh) disappointed with this movie
247382	33.565	39.783	0.0	5	 This movie focuses definitely more on the comic book side of the character the Hulk
247382	29.694	34.565	1.0	4	 (uhh) I was always a big fan of that growing up and I really liked that show
247382	48.471	55.986	0.0	7	 (umm) Whereas in the TV series he was accessible and (stutter) a lot more human than he is in this movie
247382	40.579	48.773	0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) He's definitely (uhh) larger, larger than life type of superhero slash monster
247382	60.005	63.29	0.0	9	 Although Nick Nolety is in this movie
247382	56.094	61.005	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) As far as stars go, not really a lot of big name stars
247382	67.488	72.928	0.3333333432674408	11	 {clears throat} (uhh) Sam Elliot is in this, (uhh) he's always good and Jennifer Connely is in it as well
247382	62.29	68.189	0.0	10	 I'm not really sure he managed to stumble into this
247382	75.001	80.8	-0.3333333432674408	13	 (umm) He's not really a well-known actor that they got to play the (stutter) lead character here
247382	71.928	74.754	0.3333333432674408	12	 The star is (umm) Eric Bana
247382	86.395	88.483	-1.0	15	 (uhh) He's done that before
247382	79.8	86.607	1.0	14	 It's directed by Ang Lee, an excellent director (umm) of (uhh) comic book type movies
247382	90.296	100.356	-1.0	17	 I guess (umm) if you were a big fan of the comic book character of The Hulk you might enjoy this more than I did but (umm) I was actually looking for something else
247382	88.7	91.296	-1.0	16	 So I wasn't really thrilled with this
247382	103.157	112.348	0.3333333432674408	19	 (umm) On the second disc are a bunch of (uhh) deleted scenes and also a level for the Xbox game, (uhh) stuff about the motion capture suit
247382	99.755	103.449	0.0	18	 As far as the DVD goes itself, this is a two disc set
248837	56.583	62.013	-0.6666666865348816	11	 (uhh) I mean if you like Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas I guess you could try it, I don't know
248837	49.818	55.368	-2.3333332538604736	10	 Not a very good movie, so (uhh) don't pick it up today I guess
248837	65.812	68.717	-2.6666667461395264	13	 Save the Last Dance, one out of five stars
248837	61.102	66.193	-0.6666666865348816	12	 I didn't like it but I'll let, everyone has their own opinion so
248837	5.459	9.273	0.0	1	 Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas
248837	0.271	5.92	0.3333333432674408	0	What's up Expo Ben Mazo here again, today I'm reviewing the movie of Save the Last Dance
248837	10.547	15.429	-1.6666666269302368	3	 So if I was you, I would not buy this or rent this, it's just a waste of money
248837	8.732	11.168	-1.6666666269302368	2	 I didn't enjoy this movie at all
248837	20.295	27.162	-1.0	5	 (umm) I am, I'm just not into those type of movies I mean that's just me but, if you like dance and drama movies go for it
248837	15.117	19.819	0.0	4	 It's (uhh) it's just pretty much a chick flick about dance and drama
248837	27.649	38.656	0.0	7	 And pretty much just about this girl who wants to just be a dancer and everything and she meets a friend and he helps her out and everything but
248837	26.162	28.13	-1.0	6	 I mean, I don't know
248837	45.538	50.449	-2.3333332538604736	9	 But I don't know, I'm giving it one out of five stars for this movie
248837	38.035	46.029	-2.6666667461395264	8	 Not going to ruin the plot for you or anything but I don't I don't even know if I should just ruin the plot because it's not that great of a movie, I don't even want you to see it

24xayGF5yYA	-0.488	10.759	1.6666666269302368	0	Have you ever held someone's dream in your hand? Hey welcome back for another episode of The Bootstrap Boutique where beginners build businesses
24xayGF5yYA	22.001	25.685	0.6666666865348816	3	 That's her right there
24xayGF5yYA	16.783	23.001	1.6666666269302368	2	 And to do that I have to tell you about one of my YouTube mentors, Amy Schmittauer
24xayGF5yYA	33.934	38.496	1.3333333730697632	5	 Because I was that green and I was that new and I didn't know how to do it
24xayGF5yYA	24.685	34.655	2.3333332538604736	4	 I found Amy and her YouTube channel SavvySexySocial back when I was looking for how to schedule a post to YouTube, or how to schedule a video to YouTube
24xayGF5yYA	51.624	59.159	0.6666666865348816	7	" So I go to YouTube and I search ""how to schedule a video to post on Youtube"" and Amy was there with a tutorial"
24xayGF5yYA	37.576	52.245	1.3333333730697632	6	 See back in the early days of The Bootstrap Boutique I used to shoot a video, kind of edit it, and immediately upload it and I knew that if I was going to keep doing this week after week then I was going to have to find a better way
24xayGF5yYA	62.759	69.276	1.6666666269302368	9	 Every question it felt like that I had about how to do something on YouTube, Amy had a tutorial
24xayGF5yYA	58.389	63.449	1.3333333730697632	8	 I went and looked up how to do something else and Amy was there with a tutorial
24xayGF5yYA	78.603	85.07	2.3333332538604736	11	 Her videos were not only informative, they were also entertaining and that led to me binge watching them
24xayGF5yYA	68.276	79.523	2.3333332538604736	10	 She was out there providing value and showing her expertise in a way that was truly helpful for what I needed so I became a fan immediately
24xayGF5yYA	93.16	98.969	1.0	13	" One thing that I really picked up on, and I didn't know it was a ""thing"" was the way she structured her videos"
24xayGF5yYA	84.07	93.93	1.6666666269302368	12	 She's got 700 and some, I haven't seen them all I'm sure, but I've watched a lot of them because I was learning something with each new video
24xayGF5yYA	103.267	108.088	0.0	15	 So there's not all this extra fluff in her videos
24xayGF5yYA	97.969	104.247	0.6666666865348816	14	 Her short intro, immediately giving you all the information you need, a call to action and end it
24xayGF5yYA	114.212	117.327	0.6666666865348816	17	 And I have borrowed from it
24xayGF5yYA	107.317	114.753	3.0	16	 Oh, and look, there it is right there on page 87, it's Amy's Authority Video Formula all about how to do a YouTube video
24xayGF5yYA	116.916	132.034	0.3333333432674408	19	 It's why you'll notice now in my videos I try to really just jump into the content, cut to the chase and not give a whole bunch of fluff and talk about whatever I was talking about in those early videos that probably had nothing to do with Amazon or selling on Amazon
24xayGF5yYA	202.88	209.368	1.0	32	 It's something that is going to be dogearred, underlined, and sticky noted all over
24xayGF5yYA	194.35	203.88	1.3333333730697632	31	 One, I like paper, but also I wanted to support Amy because she's given me so much through her channel and it's an awesome resource
24xayGF5yYA	177.039	195.35	2.3333332538604736	30	 Because I'll tell you, I actually am a member of Amy's book squad and I got an advanced digital copy to read for a review, and I loved the book so much and I got so much out of it that I went and I bought this book myself even though I already have it in pdf
24xayGF5yYA	213.865	216.342	1.0	36	 And I will talk to you next time
24xayGF5yYA	213.067	214.865	2.0	35	 You won't regret it
24xayGF5yYA	211.052	213.977	2.3333332538604736	34	 Check the link below, buy the book
24xayGF5yYA	208.448	211.273	1.6666666269302368	33	 So here's that call to action again
250430	56.303	60.506	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) Maybe a couple good spots, but not worth the (uhh) ticket price
250430	52.502	55.827	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (uhh) This just just was a bad movie
250430	60.883	63.0	0.0	12	 (umm) That is Vantage Point
250430	10.468	15.658	0.6666666865348816	1	 (uhh) I think this movie got number one over (uhh) the weekend
250430	1.219	10.4	0.6666666865348816	0	Hello Expo TV, how you guys doing today? I am here (uhh) to review the new blockbuster movie Vantage Point
250430	19.148	24.109	-1.6666666269302368	3	 Because this movie I I (stutter) wouldn't recommend at all
250430	15.396	19.759	-1.0	2	 Probably because there much else there
250430	29.963	35.882	-1.3333333730697632	5	 There's tons of it, but (uhh) it it it (stutter) doesn't really go anywhere
250430	23.997	30.963	1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) It does have some good actors in it though, Forrest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid (umm) etcetera etcetera
250430	41.647	46.777	0.0	7	 I thought it'd do that even a little bit different and better but, it didn't even do that
250430	36.229	42.647	-2.0	6	 (umm) It just keeps, you get tired of it kind of keep repeating itself to see these different vantage points
250430	50.018	52.824	-1.3333333730697632	9	 (umm) I I'd (stutter) say wait for TV
250430	46.546	50.01	-2.6666667461395264	8	 (umm) I can't recommend at all going to this movie
251417	8.103	11.807	0.0	1	 This movie was, it was okay
251417	0.351	8.145	1.0	0	I am reviewing Stephen King's The Mist and it's now currently playing in theaters
251417	17.112	24.857	-1.0	3	 Usually scary movies are filled with psychological terror and stuff, but this one was just shows you a bunch of monsters
251417	11.944	17.594	-0.6666666865348816	2	 I mean I like Stephen King stories (umm) but this movie wasn't scary
251417	48.112	60.566	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (uhh) Nicely planned, (umm) just the fact that they ended up showing all the monsters that were in the mist (umm) just made it (uhh) it it (stutter) just wasn't scary anymore
251417	24.396	48.164	0.6666666865348816	4	 It (uhh) the story line is basically (uhh) a mist attacks, like, an island, a small island and a bunch of people crowd into a grocery store to try and avoid the mist and, and (stutter) I won't spoil the end but the ending was (umm) {noise} kind of touching I guess, but the ending was okay
251417	63.876	68.179	-1.0	7	 They were just basically like giant bugs and giant lobsters
251417	59.995	64.876	-1.0	6	 I don't know if you can call it a horror since the monsters weren't really scary
251646	72.716	83.125	1.0	11	 Like Ted Danson is in it so, I mean, if that says anything then I know you know what I'm talking about, but yeah
251646	66.929	73.716	-2.0	10	 (umm) It's a very forgettable film and like the casting isn't that great
251646	85.048	91.396	1.0	13	 If you're in the mood for a light comedy, if there's nothing else playing at the theater
251646	82.554	86.018	-1.0	12	 (uhh) Mad Money, (uhh), it's okay
251646	0.869	6.05	1.0	1	 Today I would like to review for you a movie currently in theaters called Mad Money
251646	0.52	1.869	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello
251646	12.553	15.429	0.3333333432674408	3	 (umm) It's basically, it's a light comedy
251646	5.439	11.088	1.0	2	 It stars Ted Danson, Queen Latifah, and (uhh) Diane Keaton
251646	19.637	34.256	0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) It's about (uhh) these three women that that (stutter) work for the national reserve and (umm) they're just like, you know, normal women, they're not like (uhh) thieves or gangsters or anything like that
251646	14.429	18.132	0.0	4	 It's sort of like an adult contemporary comedy
251646	34.992	47.226	0.0	7	 And they're plotting to steal (uhh) this money that's going to be destroyed by the national reserve cause (stutter) of course the national reserve controls the money and, you know, sometimes money just has to be destroyed
251646	33.256	35.992	0.6666666865348816	6	 They're just, you know, your normal everyday women
251646	54.368	66.862	1.0	9	 So it's, like I said it's a light comedy so it was, when the movie was over I was somewhat pleased and entertained but it was sort of one of those take it or leave it kind of things
251646	46.915	54.729	0.0	8	 So (umm) they plot to steal this money for themselves and, you know, comedy ensues
251826	8.951	14.62	-3.0	1	 And this is (uhh) easily one of the worst films ever created
251826	0.361	9.552	1.0	0	{cough} Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of The Hottie and the Nottie
251826	24.176	34.565	0.0	3	 (umm) She plays a girl who (umm) years ago, when she was about six or seven years old, had a mutual crush on a little boy about the same age
251826	14.309	24.298	0.3333333432674408	2	 (uhh) For those of you not familiar with it, it is (uhh) features Paris Hilton and I believe she received top billing, so she is the star of the movie
251826	55.475	71.82	-1.6666666269302368	5	 And it is a girl wearing obviously bad makeup, (uhh) bad hair, bad fat suit, all this kind of stuff and the minute you see her you can tell that somewhere underneath there a makeover is going to occur
251826	34.593	56.086	0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) And we now grow up (uhh) twenty, twenty-five years later, and (uhh) we pick up the story where that boy goes back to find her and realizes that she is beautiful or perfect in his eyes but, and she would be considered the hottie, but there is a nottie who is not hot, for those of you not up on these terms
251826	74.432	78.964	-3.0	7	 (uhh) This movie should be avoided like the plague, it's completely awful
251826	71.04	74.744	-0.3333333432674408	6	 So (uhh) it's just coming down the turnpike
251826	88.72	91.995	-2.3333332538604736	9	 So definitely avoid this film at all costs
251826	78.872	89.371	-3.0	8	 (umm) All the (uhh) the writers (uhh) should be indicted (umm) and all the actors (uhh), you know, (stutter) tortured to some extent
251839	49.589	51.826	-0.3333333432674408	11	 The story plot's lame
251839	49.13	50.589	0.0	10	 She
251839	53.25	59.528	0.0	13	 She's supposed to be the gorgeous girl that a school mate has had a (stutter) long-time crush on
251839	50.826	53.492	-2.0	12	 It's a silly really it (uhh)
251839	65.343	80.231	0.0	15	 (uhh) Paris decides that she will not date anyone until she can find a date for her girlfriend, so she goes to all means to make her girlfriend (uhh) accessible and that's basically is the plot of the story
251839	59.177	65.345	-0.6666666865348816	14	 Her girlfriend is supposed to be (uhh) uglier than ugly and can't find a date
251839	83.122	85.968	-1.0	17	 That's really the only good thing I can say about it
251839	79.561	84.122	1.0	16	 We do see a lot of Paris, but thank goodness she has her clothes on
251839	1.209	5.312	0.6666666865348816	1	 I'd like to tell you about a movie called The Hottie and the Nottie
251839	0.68	2.209	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, expo
251839	9.819	14.73	-0.6666666865348816	3	 The only thing that really saves this movie is that Paris has her clothes on
251839	5.11	9.741	0.0	2	 This is a movie starring Paris Hilton
251839	21.203	35.194	-2.0	5	 She's very narcissistic in doing that because, after all the trouble she's been in and after all the terrible (uhh) X-rated that movies she's been in, I'm real, not even, I don't even understand why she would want to be in a movie
251839	14.977	21.644	-3.0	4	 It's really a terrible, terrible movie and it shows that, once again, Paris has to be in front of the camera
251839	40.569	44.552	-0.6666666865348816	7	 Actually, it wasn't worth a dollar to see
251839	34.712	41.22	0.0	6	 Why I went to see this? Actually it was a matinee, so I paid around five dollars to see it
251839	47.154	49.591	-1.6666666269302368	9	 She's not an actress
251839	43.552	48.114	-0.3333333432674408	8	 I suppose I was just curious to see if she could redeem herself
252177	67.448	70.513	-1.3333333730697632	10	 One out of ten, if that
252177	2.007	14.531	2.6666667461395264	1	 It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about this great new movie called The Hottie and the Nottie, starring Paris Hilton and (uhh) Joel Moore
252177	0.0	2.897	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi expotv land
252177	17.821	20.168	1.3333333730697632	3	 (umm) Just had great themes in it
252177	14.808	17.584	2.6666667461395264	2	 (umm) This is just a great movie
252177	35.052	52.534	-0.6666666865348816	5	 So he tracks her down but realizes that there's this girl that's really ugly that (umm) (stutter) that Paris Hilton's always hanging out with and that she won't go on a date without her friend who's ugly but then he (stutter) then so he's trying to find all these guys to go on dates with her
252177	19.168	35.523	0.6666666865348816	4	 I (umm) it's about this guy called Nate who is (umm) Who is (uhh) who has liked this girl since he was a little boy and he's had a lot of other girlfriends but he's finally realized that Paris Hilton is the one for him
252177	61.771	65.116	-0.6666666865348816	7	 Paris Hilton in a movie? Please, come on
252177	52.452	61.943	-0.3333333432674408	6	 But (uhh) it turns out it's one of the best movies of the year and I would say definitely go and watch it if you're planning on having the worst time of your life
252177	65.892	68.039	-1.6666666269302368	9	 I don't think you should watch it
252177	64.395	66.542	-2.0	8	 This is not a good movie
25271	74.632	77.248	-2.0	11	 It's (uhh) incredibly boring
25271	71.668	74.893	0.0	10	 It's like a surveillance camera on a spaceship
25271	76.597	87.195	-2.0	12	 But there's (stutter) I guess there's some neat ideas or something cause I (uhh) {laugh} I couldn't, I was asleep for most of it but people just, that's what I'm reading on the internet
25271	9.53	15.788	-0.3333333432674408	1	 And I took the word brief very poignantly because this movie is anything but
25271	0.0	9.991	0.0	0	Hi I'm Jesse and (uhh) today I'm going to talk to you for just a brief moment about Stanley Kubrick's two thousand one A space Odyssey
25271	25.873	34.974	1.3333333730697632	3	 Sure it's a classic and there's a lot of symbolism that you see all over in in (stutter) our culture, (uhh) especially The Simpson's
25271	15.297	24.977	-0.6666666865348816	2	 It's (uhh) about, yeah it says here, four thousand minutes long which it translates to over forty hours somehow and (umm)
25271	41.018	47.506	0.6666666865348816	5	 And so, you kind of have to see this at some point on your life just so you know what it's about
25271	34.722	41.31	0.0	4	 But (uhh) And and (stutter) of course that whole I'm afraid I can't do that Dave is from this
25271	56.653	59.678	-2.6666667461395264	7	 This movie is immensely boring
25271	47.034	57.653	-2.3333332538604736	6	 But (uhh) if you're looking to have like a nice relaxing time or if you really enjoy science fiction, (umm) spend your money elsewhere
25271	65.712	72.668	0.6666666865348816	9	 It's it's (stutter) like four days where they're just in stasis and the camera moves around occasionally
25271	58.678	66.712	0.0	8	 There's one part where they (uhh) go to Mars or something and they show the entire trip to Mars like unabridged
254298	80.399	84.502	-0.6666666865348816	11	 I don't know
254298	76.637	80.201	-0.3333333432674408	10	 And the saber-toothed tiger is like, alright that's cool
254298	93.549	96.235	-1.6666666269302368	13	 It wasn't visually that stunning
254298	83.821	93.731	-2.0	12	 Anyways, the xxx in it like, weren't even that cool and I mean there were like, mammoths, CGI mammoths that were sorta neat I guess
254298	100.174	105.863	-1.0	15	 It was just an overall disappointment but, I mean it was funny to see just cause we could make fun of it afterwards
254298	96.512	99.448	-1.6666666269302368	14	 (umm) The girl wasn't even like that attractive
254298	104.903	108.218	-2.3333332538604736	16	 But other than that, (umm) sort of a waste of time and money
254298	1.488	3.595	-0.6666666865348816	0	Ten thousand B
254298	12.234	19.689	-3.0	3	 (umm) This movie was absolutely abysmal, is the only word I can think of to describe it
254298	3.733	11.557	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm) I'm not sure what I miss more, the five dollars I spent to go see it or the two hours I spent watching it
254298	24.286	49.591	-2.0	5	 It was (umm) (uhh) The only err only time will tell the difference between legend and truth, and you're just like, what the heck does that even mean? Does that Mean that this whole movie is just a lie? Anyways, (umm) this movie follows the story of (umm) this one guy who's like the chosen ,you know, guy, to like overthrow these Egyptians
254298	21.582	25.057	-2.3333332538604736	4	 (umm) Just the first line of the movie was just, it was just ridiculous
254298	58.199	63.769	0.0	7	 And it's just it's, it's (stutter) really ridiculous and then there's there's (stutter)
254298	48.591	58.401	-1.6666666269302368	6	 I don't, it's really unclear, as they go from like Himalayas to like, a rain forest to a desert in like three days, just walking
254298	71.02	77.637	-0.3333333432674408	9	 Aww but wait, you're sort of trapped in these sticks, I'm not gonna kill you so don't kill me
254298	62.938	71.82	-1.6666666269302368	8	 Okay there's this one part where like, where he's in like, this pit, and there's like a saber-toothed tiger in there and he was just like, I'm gonna kill you
25522	10.039	26.334	-1.0	1	 The (uhh) movie came out last summer and I watched it recently and I feel that it was kind of a lackluster effort by the (uhh) people who made this movie
25522	2.346	7.906	0.3333333432674408	0	Right now I'm going to be reviewing The Descent
25522	30.382	45.42	-0.6666666865348816	3	 This year they decide to go exploring some (uhh) underground caves and (uhh) they get lost due to a cave in and proceed to be attacked by some weird kind of creatures
25522	25.942	31.382	0.0	2	 Basically it's about a group of women who annually go on an adventure
25522	49.988	64.118	-1.6666666269302368	5	 There's a little twist at the end, which I didn't really care for and had a little trouble understanding and seemed a little disjointed there at the very end
25522	45.278	50.519	-1.0	4	 The movie is really fast paced, kind of lacks a plot
255224	89.997	98.749	-2.0	10	 (uhh) So maybe he needs to go back and do Wild Hogs Two or just do something to get his career back on track, but but (stutter) this is just a big mess
255224	7.365	18.98	-0.3333333432674408	1	 (umm) Ever since the American Pie movies came out around ten years ago (uhh) people have been coming up with movies like Road Trip and College Road Trip, all this type of (uhh) different stuff
255224	0.0	7.576	-2.0	0	Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of College Road Trip, which was a complete utter waste of time
255224	26.232	36.89	-1.0	3	 (uhh) And because Martin Lawrence is in it (uhh) it's kind of funny because he's he's (stutter) a seasoned, funny, professional guy (uhh) but the movie is just watered down
255224	18.529	26.444	0.0	2	 Well this one basically stars (uhh) Martin Lawrence and he's reconnecting with his daughter who's getting ready to go to college
255224	54.607	60.346	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) I would say I can't really think of anybody that might (uhh) enjoy the movie
255224	35.89	54.25	-3.0	4	 It's got that (uhh) really awful RV meets Are We There Yet type of vibe to it where it's so family oriented, it has such, such (stutter) moments every five or ten minutes of just unfunny stupidity that it's just a real challenge to enjoy
255224	65.433	74.325	-2.0	7	 (uhh) If you were in the bathroom during the whole film (stutter), you know, you might like it too but if you're forced to watch it then you're pretty much not gonna enjoy it at all
255224	60.145	65.565	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (uhh) If if (stutter) you were sleeping or comatose in the film you might enjoy it
255224	78.992	90.338	-1.0	9	" (uhh) It's kind of sad but, you know, you probably thought a year or two ago when you saw (uhh), if you did see, Wild Hogs you'd probably think ""well wow, he can't get any lower"" but he actually did"
255224	74.741	79.303	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) I definitely think Martin Lawrence needs to go back to some other funny things
255226	89.298	94.459	0.0	11	 So (umm) it all wraps up (uhh) toward the end as you might expect
255226	79.62	89.77	0.0	10	 And it it involves a lot of scenes where she (umm) is sort of, like, hovering over them or watching him and her as the new romance develops and stuff
255226	95.195	115.082	-2.0	13	 But (umm) just overall, it's just a painful exercise to watch, not a really good movie, something that you should steer clear of (umm) even if (uhh) I'm not a fan of Desperate Housewives, but even even (stutter) (uhh) the the (stutter) person that I went with (uhh) she is, and she even hated the movie
255226	93.459	95.716	0.0	12	 I won't give anything away
255226	118.662	127.474	-1.0	15	 (umm) If you have to entertain yourself this weekend, (uhh) buy a puzzle, maybe dogs playing poker, put it together or something, you know
255226	114.082	118.764	-2.3333332538604736	14	 So just overall just steer clear of this movie
255226	1.019	14.122	0.0	1	 My name is Mike, and this is my ExpoTV movie review of the film Over Her Dead Body, which is a movie that I guess (umm) I I (stutter) don't know, words really can't describe
255226	0.869	2.019	0.0	0	Hi
255226	14.947	17.913	0.6666666865348816	3	 It might make a good date movie
255226	13.122	15.588	-1.3333333730697632	2	 It wasn't very good
255226	27.519	43.545	0.0	5	 But basically in it, you have (umm) Eva Longoria Parker, from Desperate Housewives, and she plays a bride that accidentally gets killed on her wedding day and (uhh) her fiance slash husband from that wedding day is Paul Rudd
255226	17.222	28.449	-2.3333332538604736	4	 (uhh) But basically, the plot (umm) is just kind of, it seemed sort of TV movie-ish, like (uhh) like something that even Lifetime might even reject
255226	49.878	61.035	0.0	7	 (umm) And then (uhh) what happens from there is he decides to go consult a psychic and go sort of deal with the with the (stutter) whole situation in therapy
255226	43.133	49.94	-0.3333333432674408	6	 And (uhh) he (umm) basically takes it pretty hard, as most of us would
255226	70.511	80.241	0.0	9	 (umm) And then (uhh) from the grave, Eva Longoria Parker decides to (uhh) torture him and, and (stutter) try and break them up and everything
255226	60.933	70.334	0.3333333432674408	8	 And, as you might expect, the psychic is an attractive female, because it is movieland, and he starts to fall in love with her
255338	69.813	75.332	-2.3333332538604736	11	 I don't know why they released this in theaters, it doesn't deserve to be in theaters
255338	57.062	70.174	-3.0	10	 If I could give it a zero I would but I know there's no option for zero so I'm going to have to give College Road Trip a one out of five and recommend that everyone stays away from this movie
255338	2.206	5.751	0.0	1	 I have a movie review called College Road Trip
255338	0.0	3.007	0.0	0	What's up Expo Tv
255338	8.542	11.258	0.3333333432674408	3	 (uhh) Went to see this with my younger sister
255338	5.369	8.325	0.6666666865348816	2	 Came out March two thousand eight
255338	12.184	37.449	-0.3333333432674408	5	 It was directed by Roger Cumble and it's (uhh) about how (stutter) this high student which is (stutter) Raven from (stutter) That's So Raven (uhh) goes around the country to choose a college that she wants but her dad who's a cop but played by Martin Lawrence, (uhh) goes along with her to try and find the perfect college for her
255338	10.647	13.184	-2.0	4	 It was absolutely terrible
255338	44.56	50.888	-0.3333333432674408	7	 It's definitely directed towards like a younger generation cuz of like Raven was in it
255338	36.449	45.101	-3.0	6	 And (uhh) it's just a really terrible movie to and, terrible attempt at a comedy
255338	54.727	57.553	-2.3333332538604736	9	 I do not recommend checking this out
255338	51.345	55.727	-2.3333332538604736	8	 (uhh) But it was absolutely terrible
255343	55.525	58.96	-2.0	11	 It's not a good sequel at all
255343	53.31	56.395	-2.3333332538604736	10	 (uhh) But this sequel, not good
255343	58.439	61.185	-2.0	12	 I do not recommend seeing this movie
255343	5.718	8.704	0.0	1	 Came out February two thousand eight
255343	0.0	6.489	0.0	0	What's up Expo, I have a movie review for you, it's Step Up two the Streets
255343	11.665	17.284	0.0	3	 Basically it's like the romance, but with like dancing involved
255343	8.153	11.897	0.0	2	 It was directed by Jon by Jon Chu
255343	30.023	33.657	-1.6666666269302368	5	 But this one it's just like, not that good
255343	17.701	31.023	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (uhh) It doesn't have like the like like (stutter) (uhh) Channing Tatum's not in it which pretty much made Step Up I cause like (uhh) because like the storyline was decent
255343	39.751	42.487	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) I wasn't too impressed with the movie
255343	32.657	39.344	-0.3333333432674408	6	 People in it are like Robert Hoffman and other like people that I've never even heard of before
255343	45.458	53.372	-0.3333333432674408	9	 It's It's (stutter) just like (uhh) like they go to the same school and like dancing brings them together
255343	43.383	46.199	-2.0	8	 (uhh) It really really wasn't that good
255852	67.937	75.402	0.3333333432674408	10	 So Will Ferrell Semi-Pro I might recommend you just see this at home instead of in the theater
255852	3.513	8.764	0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) For my review today I'll do Semi-Pro, the Will Ferrell new comedy out in theaters
255852	2.486	3.805	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hello
255852	20.515	30.824	-1.0	3	 But I'll have to admit for this review that Semi-Pro xxx on the same kind of comedy and jokes all the rest of them worked on, but it's almost getting a little stale
255852	8.143	21.515	0.0	2	 I caught this about two days ago in the evening, I went to my local theater with my friend and both of him and myself were big fans of, like, Old School and even Ricky Bobby and Blades of Glory were okay
255852	34.962	47.366	-0.6666666865348816	5	 He's attacked by an animal in one scene, the downtrodden like, you know, ABA team you've got to win games to rally the crowd and the team and I don't know
255852	30.283	35.962	-2.0	4	 I hate to say it cause I love Will Ferrell but the jokes are all kind of the same you've seen before
255852	50.886	59.219	-0.3333333432674408	7	 I don't want to say skip it or, you know why not get it as a rental later on? It may not be worth the full ten dollars or nine dollars they charge for a movie nowadays
255852	46.645	51.477	-0.3333333432674408	6	 You you (stutter) want to like Will Ferrell but my reviews have to be mixed but negative
255852	64.505	68.119	0.6666666865348816	9	 There are some funny moments but they're far and few between
255852	58.818	64.946	-1.6666666269302368	8	 As the price gets up there I have to be more and more picky about what I go to and this one I probably wouldn't go to again
256174	63.507	68.209	0.3333333432674408	11	 Everything was romantic comedy-ish
256174	54.887	63.19	-2.0	10	 Now, I don't have anything against the actors, the director, I just don't think it was a movie that was worth being made
256174	70.142	79.862	0.6666666865348816	13	 Unbelievable leaps of the imagination you have to suspend your disbelief like, I don't know
256174	68.097	70.324	-2.0	12	 It was cliched
256174	83.601	87.784	0.3333333432674408	15	 If you like that sort of thing, go see it
256174	79.261	83.444	-2.6666667461395264	14	 Like an elephant was stepping on your pants
256174	3.034	9.871	0.3333333432674408	1	 And I am reviewing the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses for Expo Tv dot com
256174	0.61	3.176	0.3333333432674408	0	My name is Eric Nederland
256174	12.114	15.059	-0.3333333432674408	3	 I did see this movie
256174	10.557	12.196	0.3333333432674408	2	 Yes
256174	21.353	26.114	0.3333333432674408	5	 It was everything you might expect from such a movie
256174	15.566	19.689	-1.3333333730697632	4	 Not by my own choice, I was forced to
256174	33.505	44.872	-2.3333332538604736	7	 Now, I don't know about you, but I don't think I'm going to be a wedding attendant twenty-seven times and I don't know how many people really will be
256174	25.593	33.517	0.0	6	 Romantic comedy, about a woman who has been a bridesmaid twenty-seven times
256174	48.611	54.809	-2.0	9	 But unfortunately that was one of the more believable plot points
256174	44.829	48.434	0.3333333432674408	8	 That in itself was a little bit unbelievable
256935	116.477	128.831	-2.6666667461395264	24	 But for everyone else I really think this is a giant miss of a movie from a great director who I'm not even sure if I can say he's great anymore because he did this movie
256935	129.966	136.404	0.0	25	 (umm) I would just go pop Independence Day {cough} watch that a few times and then call it a night
256935	100.812	105.025	0.6666666865348816	20	 And I'm not going to necessarily say that's a bad thing
256935	104.763	107.499	0.0	21	 So this is ten thousand B
256935	106.609	117.377	-1.6666666269302368	23	 If you're really into like, old things that suck, I would recommend this movie fully to you
256935	-0.488	6.519	0.0	0	Hey Expo tv this is my video review of the movie ten thousand B
256935	19.357	26.803	2.6666667461395264	3	 Both those movies were excellent and I think ninety-nine percent of the population will agree with you on that
256935	8.861	19.11	0.0	2	 (umm) If you know anything about the director you know he directed Independence Day, and he also I believe directed The Patriot
256935	26.192	34.046	0.0	4	 However, if you're like me and you use that to say, hey, let's go see ten thousand B
256935	36.528	38.925	-2.6666667461395264	7	 You're going to be highly disappointed
256935	33.046	36.63	0.0	6	 it's by that guy who directed Independence Day
256935	41.108	47.785	-1.3333333730697632	9	 It's about these like people just running around doing pointless stuff that you don't care about
256935	38.753	41.449	-3.0	8	 This movie is horrible
256935	46.915	53.592	-0.6666666865348816	10	 {cough} I would almost describe it as like a reality tv show from ten thousand B
256935	58.289	61.464	-2.3333332538604736	13	 I just want this to end
256935	52.592	58.112	-2.3333332538604736	12	 like I don't care about this guy running around in the jungle
256935	69.044	71.78	-1.6666666269302368	15	 The movie has no substance
256935	60.813	69.007	-2.6666667461395264	14	 {cough} There's really like, I didn't (stutter) catch too much of a plot like there's like (umm) there's this little plot that's stupid
256935	74.532	85.16	-1.6666666269302368	17	 And it is really long, like I don't know I don't know (stutter) the exact minutes or anything but I would say it's got to be close to two hours long and that is
256935	71.549	75.053	-1.6666666269302368	16	 It's not interesting, it's not gonna hold your attention
256935	91.244	101.383	-2.0	19	 {cough} I don't know I mean, you can rent this movie and just fast forward it through the boring parts but, I think you would miss about an hour and a half of the movie if you did that
256935	85.028	90.418	-2.6666667461395264	18	 For a movie that sucks this bad, two hours is way too much, so
256976	53.859	55.498	-1.6666666269302368	11	 Not one bit
256976	49.01	54.54	-2.6666667461395264	10	 (uhh) Way too many stereotypes, I I wanna (stutter) I wouldn't recommend this movie
256976	66.271	70.493	-2.3333332538604736	13	 So no, please don't go see this movie it's horrible
256976	54.577	66.692	-1.3333333730697632	12	 I would just wait for it to come out on a network television when it gets replayed three times for a weekend and then every other weekend for the rest of its life
256976	70.152	74.275	-1.0	14	 Unless you like the others then go see this, otherwise wait
256976	3.783	6.738	0.0	1	 As a formality here's the movie ticket
256976	0.0	4.533	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns
256976	12.054	20.756	0.0	3	 Alright, now if you've seen any of the other Tyler Perry movies this is exactly like it, so if you like those, you'll like this
256976	5.938	12.006	0.0	2	 Here and here's the movie ticket sideways, that's not a formality that's just for fun
256976	25.992	30.664	0.0	5	 The only one saving grace for this movie was Medea
256976	20.525	26.503	-2.3333332538604736	4	 It's too much for me at this point if I see another Tyler Perry movie I'm never gonna go see it
256976	30.841	38.067	1.3333333730697632	7	 I I (stutter) don't know why but Tyler Perry dressed up as a large, tall woman makes me laugh
256976	29.664	31.841	2.0	6	 Medea's always hilarious
256976	40.35	48.334	-1.6666666269302368	9	 Now this movie is yeah, as I said, exactly the same as the other ones, it's like a love family type story
256976	38.145	40.841	0.0	8	 Don't know about you, but it does me
257045	45.727	49.032	-1.0	11	 But all in all, it seems like he's trying too hard
257045	43.353	46.288	0.3333333432674408	10	 It has, does have some funny scenes
257045	55.575	64.467	-1.6666666269302368	13	 It's based on a play of the same name, and, I don't know, I wouldn't really waste my money unless you're a big fan of his
257045	48.401	55.946	-1.6666666269302368	12	 If you're a Tyler Perry fan, you may enjoy this movie, although I don't even like this one as much as his others and I didn't even like the others too much
257045	2.725	9.811	0.0	1	 I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns
257045	0.0	3.556	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, ExpoTV users
257045	11.725	17.334	0.3333333432674408	3	 It's about family and love and drama and has some (stutter) comedy
257045	9.46	12.395	1.0	2	 This movie, it has a good heart
257045	23.318	27.601	-0.3333333432674408	5	 But she gets fired from her job and begins to get hopeless
257045	16.434	23.77	0.0	4	 It's basically the story about a single mother raising her children, and she really wants to keep her kids off the street, obviously
257045	32.448	37.947	-0.3333333432674408	7	 So she decides to take her family from Chicago down to Georgia for the funeral
257045	27.389	32.949	-0.6666666865348816	6	 And then she finds out that a father, her father that she never even knew existed, had died
257045	40.978	44.353	1.0	9	 Basically, it has some touching scenes
257045	37.396	40.861	0.0	8	 And she meets a whole family she never knew existed
257531	64.076	67.77	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (umm) As a movie overall, I thought the acting was poor
257531	59.157	63.988	0.3333333432674408	10	 (umm) But this movie kind of takes another direction and kind of opens your eyes to different issues in the world
257531	71.14	78.515	-1.6666666269302368	13	 I just think it's hard to make that work into a cohesive (umm) watchable (umm) story
257531	67.368	72.14	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (umm) The story could have been filmed a lot better I think, because it's very interesting
257531	82.205	88.842	0.0	15	 (umm) If it was purely (umm) (stutters) If it was purely historical, I think it would work
257531	78.423	81.728	-0.6666666865348816	14	 (umm) So the story was definitely very poor how they did it
257531	89.857	93.551	-1.6666666269302368	17	 But as a movie, (umm) it definitely falls short
257531	88.091	90.857	0.0	16	 (uhh) Maybe to be shown in schools, something like that
257531	92.591	95.906	-1.6666666269302368	18	 So I'm gonna say one out of five stars, as a movie
257531	2.635	6.04	0.0	1	 Today I'm here to talk about the movie Blind Mountain
257531	0.0	2.717	0.0	0	Hey Expo TV
257531	10.108	16.895	-0.3333333432674408	3	 (umm) This is about (umm) the slave trafficking, in (uhh) in particular Asia
257531	6.117	10.35	0.6666666865348816	2	 (uhh) This movie's about something you rarely rarely hear about
257531	25.404	31.771	0.0	5	 (umm) This is something that goes on with reasonable frequency (umm) especially in Eastern Asia
257531	17.083	25.306	0.0	4	 (umm) This movie's about (umm) young individual who is captured and sold as a sexual slave
257531	37.905	45.78	-0.6666666865348816	7	 He's kind of trapped in this horrible, horrible cycle (umm) with with (stutter) no way out it seems
257531	32.059	38.905	0.0	6	 (umm) This boy is taken to a remote village in China and he kinda really sees no support from anywhere
257531	52.901	58.501	-0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) Instead of, you normally hear about (uhh) American slavery of the African Americans
257531	45.947	52.325	-1.0	8	 (umm) And the movie's really kind of just about white slavery or Asian slavery
257771	77.276	79.742	-1.3333333730697632	11	 It wasn't that good
257771	70.272	77.178	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (umm) So I think that's what they were really trying to push for was like the same audience, the same, oh this is going to be huge and epic
257771	89.947	99.228	0.3333333432674408	13	 (umm) I would rent this one or maybe ask for it for like a holiday present just so I don't have to spend money on it
257771	79.052	88.912	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (uhh) Three hundred was completely epic, this if if (stutter) you want a comparison just three hundred here, ten thousand BC here
257771	105.272	109.964	-2.0	15	 I'm going to give this a two out of five
257771	98.278	103.828	-1.0	14	 But the special effects are great, historically accurate no
257771	4.721	11.208	0.3333333432674408	1	 As validation here is my movie ticket which kinda got crumpled in my pocket I apologize
257771	0.0	5.451	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie ten thousand BC
257771	15.726	22.822	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) Okay this movie bothered me a lot just because it was really not historically accurate
257771	11.086	14.96	1.0	2	 There we go, yeah, front pocket
257771	27.369	32.759	1.3333333730697632	5	 (uhh) Special effects were great but the cast that, you knew nobody
257771	22.121	28.2	-1.6666666269302368	4	 But I don't know if they were trying to set out for that but that's the part that just confuses me
257771	40.839	50.359	-0.3333333432674408	7	 It it (stutter) follows the story of this (stutter) mammoth hunter and it, trying to do better for his tribe, or trying to get his tribe a better life
257771	35.261	41.449	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) It it's (stutter) a good movie
257771	53.829	70.134	-2.3333332538604736	9	 They were trying to push this as a like, the next big epic movie just like three hundred but no it didn't come anywhere close and the best part is, if you (uhh) look back to the release dates, three hundred was released the same weekend just a year prior to it
257771	51.105	54.43	1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) It's got a lot of really good action
259260	95.734	98.36	0.0	24	 somewhere in there
259260	99.296	103.419	1.0	25	 (umm) It's, as I said it's slapstick funny
259260	102.419	108.068	0.6666666865348816	26	 Makes fun of all superhero movies, at least for the most part
259260	110.39	114.284	0.3333333432674408	27	 (umm) What more can you really say about a really dumb movie
259260	81.746	86.268	-0.3333333432674408	20	 I just had a few friends who wanted to see this, I'm like alright fine, I'll go
259260	85.836	88.732	-2.0	21	 If you get into that situation, don't do it
259260	87.852	89.899	-1.0	22	 Learn from my mistake
259260	88.899	95.896	-2.3333332538604736	23	 As (stutter) as I had to slap myself over the head, I should have learned from the first eight mistakes
259260	114.94	118.923	0.0	28	 (umm) Stick with Airplane, Leslie Nielson, you did that one great
259260	118.013	120.171	0.0	29	 You're funnier than the rest of em
259260	3.653	6.339	-0.6666666865348816	1	 Before I begin this is what I need to do
259260	0.131	4.653	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie Superhero Movie
259260	16.394	18.601	-2.0	3	 I'm ashamed I have this
259260	5.908	16.207	-1.0	2	 {slaps palm on forehead} Ok, I'll explain why in a minute, but as always I hold on to it, here's the movie ticket
259260	21.642	23.57	-0.3333333432674408	5	 I really shouldn't have
259260	18.25	22.063	-1.3333333730697632	4	 Alright, I don't know why I went to see this
259260	28.427	30.464	-1.6666666269302368	7	 I should've learned my lesson
259260	22.57	29.098	-1.0	6	 I should've learned my lesson from four Scary Movies, Epic Movie, Date Movie
259260	31.48	37.708	1.0	9	 So I figured, okay this could be good, it's got Leslie Nielson in it again and he always amuses me every single time
259260	29.694	32.34	0.3333333432674408	8	 No, I like slapstick though
259260	142.747	144.715	-2.0	39	 (uhh) One out of five
259260	141.131	142.949	-0.6666666865348816	38	 That's my advice
259260	40.549	45.091	1.6666666269302368	11	 Airplane's amazing, (umm) yeah that's why I just like him so much
259260	38.185	40.771	1.6666666269302368	10	 And yes he was funny in this one
259260	51.135	54.44	0.0	13	 Hannah Montana, Nickelodeon, okay maybe not
259260	44.091	51.367	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Okay this kind of has Drake Bell in his first starring role, the Nickelodeon icon or whatever
259260	60.354	65.664	0.6666666865348816	15	 Okay, that's about it for the plot
259260	54.378	61.354	-0.6666666865348816	14	 (umm) He (uhh) gets into a freak accident and turns into the new clumsy superhero know as Dragonfly
259260	69.424	71.421	0.0	17	 (umm) Look I got an apple
259260	65.233	68.658	-2.3333332538604736	16	 Yes, it is in depth as a paper bag
259260	75.39	82.327	-1.3333333730697632	19	 As always, it's not worth spending as much as I did to go see this
259260	73.235	76.3	1.3333333730697632	18	 (umm) Okay the slapstick in it is funny
259260	124.459	126.676	-1.3333333730697632	31	 I wasted so much on this
259260	120.697	124.74	-1.3333333730697632	30	 Please don't tag on to horrible movies cause then I'll go see them
259260	138.636	142.131	-0.6666666865348816	37	 Just wait for that long if you actually want to see this movie
259260	136.96	138.918	0.3333333432674408	36	 Go for those
259260	131.572	137.202	-1.0	35	 Not even a regular rental, wait for the rental to be there so long it's now cheaper
259260	129.986	132.343	-0.6666666865348816	34	 Not even a budget theater
259260	127.841	130.647	-0.3333333432674408	33	 (umm) Wait for it to become a budget renter
259260	125.835	127.673	-2.3333332538604736	32	 Don't go see this
25t8nrkUfRY	5.09	13.343	0.3333333432674408	1	I just need to get an outfit so we're going to go shop around you can get it up serve a look serve a look shall I
25t8nrkUfRY	-0.368	5.162	0.6666666865348816	0	Kelly and Ryan which I'm super excited about it's Gonna be with Colleen um
260011	33.685	37.588	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) But this movie was not very good
260011	29.095	32.769	1.3333333730697632	10	 He still is an amazing actor
260011	43.582	53.213	0.0	13	 And Sanaa Lathan from Blade, and Dean Cain from Lois and Clark and Ripley's Believe It Or Not
260011	38.234	43.924	1.3333333730697632	12	 (umm) It's got Eva Mendes in it though, which is, she's beautiful you know that
260011	71.319	74.744	-1.0	20	 I just, I wasn't feeling Out of Time
260011	52.751	57.194	1.0	14	 So if you're into any of those, those (stutter) people I mean check it out
260011	63.587	66.612	0.6666666865348816	17	 Denzel's the, the good guy
260011	61.871	64.118	0.0	16	 (umm) It's a cop story
260011	68.406	71.172	0.0	19	 He's the good guy but
260011	66.021	68.528	0.0	18	 Look at him on the cover
260011	1.209	6.888	0.0	1	 I've got a Denzel Washington movie right here, Out of Time
260011	0.0	2.209	0.0	0	What's up Expo
260011	9.57	12.795	2.3333332538604736	3	 I'm a huge Denzel fan
260011	7.824	10.021	-1.6666666269302368	2	 Didn't like this movie
260011	15.287	19.719	1.3333333730697632	5	 And he, he (stutter) is a good actor in this movie
260011	12.084	16.287	2.0	4	 I love every Denzel movie I think he's an amazing actor
260011	22.76	27.401	-1.6666666269302368	7	 It's not that, I just don't like the movie
260011	20.634	23.39	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) Like he plays his character well
260011	27.239	29.596	0.0	9	 He plays his character good
260011	56.882	60.776	-1.6666666269302368	15	 I didn't like it but that doesn't mean you won't
260011	26.431	28.239	-1.0	8	 The movie's terrible
261267	47.613	52.454	-1.0	11	 It's just, I mean it's a really fantasy movie, there's a lot of like weird stuff
261267	45.298	48.054	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (stutter) I don't even know if kids would like it
261267	60.264	64.367	-1.6666666269302368	13	 And like some of the camera work is just like oh this is horrible
261267	51.454	61.125	-1.3333333730697632	12	 I mean that's cool but Jodie Foster doesn't do a great job, you know, so the only good thing about the acting is Abigail Breslin
261267	69.523	76.51	-0.6666666865348816	15	 I mean if you have to see it go see it because your little kid might want to see it or something, or your little brother or sister
261267	64.265	70.523	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I mean on a on a (stutter) scale of like stars I would give it definitely like two stars out of five
261267	77.844	81.429	-1.3333333730697632	17	 I mean you could definitely take them to see something else
261267	75.809	78.844	-2.3333332538604736	16	 But overall it's just really not worth seeing
261267	87.852	92.204	-1.3333333730697632	19	 So I mean if you if you (stutter) have to, go see it
261267	80.688	88.852	-1.3333333730697632	18	" If they're enthusiastic about seeing it take them because, I mean, maybe they might like it but you will have to sit through something that's really you're just like ""I do not want to be here"""
261267	4.361	14.271	-0.6666666865348816	1	 Alright, now, it's a kid's movie okay? But now overall though kid's movies usually are pretty good overall, like as movies
261267	0.63	4.873	0.0	0	Expotv, let's talk about Nim's Island
261267	14.967	22.373	0.0	3	 Let me tell you why, alright? Now, well the acting was good, especially Abigail Breslin
261267	13.68	15.868	-1.3333333730697632	2	 This movie was not
261267	23.548	33.398	-2.0	5	 Now other times it's just like the story line wasn't that good for a kid's movie, you know? Normally you can go see a kid's movie no matter what age you are and love it
261267	21.373	24.099	0.3333333432674408	4	 That was the only good thing about the movie
261267	35.231	37.199	0.0	7	 Pixar, whatever
261267	32.737	36.231	0.3333333432674408	6	 Like, I mean, all Disney stuff, everything
261267	38.743	45.161	0.0	9	 I mean there definitely was not like any like adult humor, you know, that only adults get and stuff
261267	36.608	39.743	-1.3333333730697632	8	 This one just it just didn't have that many elements
261326	3.653	8.634	-0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) Today I am going to talk about a new released movie, Superhero movie
261326	1.947	3.675	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi guys
261326	21.752	39.574	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh) This spoof movie is like (uhh) not that much interesting because (uhh) I don't like spoof movie that much but (uhh) I like the movies (uhh) Meet the Spartans but this movie doesn't (uhh) I I (stutter) don't like this movie much
261326	8.652	21.694	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) This is a spoof movie of Spider Man but you can also say something, something (stutter) into account like X-man and (umm) some other movies
261900	181.22	186.42	-1.0	42	 I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars because there's not a lot of redeeming quality to it
261900	186.148	194.442	1.3333333730697632	43	 (umm) One of the best scenes is just kind of a touchy moment (umm) where, you know, a father and daughter have to say goodbye to one another
261900	110.63	116.788	-1.6666666269302368	24	 And for her to be alone on this island is ridiculous without a father or a babysitter, anything
261900	116.686	120.899	-2.6666667461395264	25	 So that's the first (uhh) ridiculous part of the movie
261900	119.899	128.063	-1.6666666269302368	26	 The next ridiculous part is that a letter written by a little girl to a famous author would actually solicit a visit
261900	127.611	132.981	-0.6666666865348816	27	 I mean, maybe the author would write back and say, you know, thanks for the letter, blah, blah, blah
261900	87.483	91.595	-1.0	20	 Now, this is not a very realistic story at all
261900	91.414	101.643	-1.6666666269302368	21	 (umm) First of all, who lives on a deserted island, a deserted volcanic island, with (uhh) just a father and a daughter? Nobody does that
261900	101.112	108.138	-1.0	22	 And especially when the father sails away to do science experiments and leaves Nim all by herself
261900	107.138	111.301	0.0	23	 I mean, she can't be more than, I don't know, twelve or thirteen
261900	193.761	197.854	-1.0	44	 And, you know, if that's the best scene in the movie, I think that says a lot
261900	132.271	137.072	-0.3333333432674408	28	 But, no, the author actually comes out to the island to be with this little girl
261900	136.641	139.107	-2.0	29	 (uhh) That's also ridiculous
261900	173.168	179.296	-1.0	40	 I didn't know that this was supposed to be, you know, a joke and supposed to be all creative and imaginative
261900	178.296	181.96	-2.3333332538604736	41	 So I was expecting a lot, and I was disappointed
261900	1.478	3.915	0.0	1	 This is Aubs eighty four
261900	0.0	0.672	0.0	0	Hey, ExpoTV
261900	6.367	11.029	0.0	3	 And this stars Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler
261900	2.915	6.788	0.0	2	 Today, I'm going to talk about the movie, Nim's Island
261900	17.232	24.917	-1.0	5	 He plays a little more of a bit part in this film, so if you're going to go rush out to see the movie for Gerard Butler, you're going to be disappointed
261900	10.707	17.863	0.0	4	 (umm) Many of you will recognize Gerard Butler from movies such as three hundred, where he played the main character in that film
261900	28.387	31.662	0.0	7	 Nim is the main character of the movie
261900	24.296	28.828	0.0	6	 He plays the role of a a (stutter) father
261900	37.446	40.282	0.0	9	 (umm) They're kind of secluded from everybody
261900	30.662	37.189	0.0	8	 She is a little girl who lives on this island with her father, Gerard Butler
261900	170.524	174.168	0.0	39	 I guess when I went to the film, I didn't know what to expect
261900	166.164	171.364	-1.3333333730697632	38	 And definitely if you're an adult, don't go in prepared to believe everything
261900	46.306	53.532	0.0	11	 And to counter this, Nim has a lot of fanciful creatures that she's created
261900	40.07	47.306	0.0	10	 (umm) The father is a scientist who does a lot of research and needs a lot of time for his experiments, so he doesn't have a lot of time for his daughter, Nim
261900	55.934	58.092	0.0	13	 She loves to read books
261900	52.532	55.687	0.3333333432674408	12	 She has a very active imagination in this one
261900	58.608	63.459	0.0	15	 And her favorite author is played by Jodie Foster
261900	57.221	59.538	0.0	14	 That's her favorite hobby
261900	67.209	69.416	0.0	17	 A storm comes out
261900	62.888	67.68	0.3333333432674408	16	 And what happens is, Nim's father goes out to sea to do a experiment
261900	70.601	87.804	0.0	19	 Nim writes her favorite author for some help, saying that her father's lost, what does she do, how does she get through life, I mean, what's her next step And Jodie Foster's character comes out to the island to hang out with Nim and try to help her cope and do things like that
261900	68.635	71.072	-0.3333333432674408	18	 He gets lost out at sea
261900	141.101	147.568	1.3333333730697632	31	 It's very fanciful (umm), lots of crazy stuff going on in the way of imagination
261900	139.734	142.021	-1.6666666269302368	30	 (umm) So it's not very believable
261900	163.28	167.164	1.6666666269302368	37	 (umm) But it's just kind of a fun movie for the younger generation
261900	158.641	163.402	-0.3333333432674408	36	 I would say the storm scene might be a little frightening for some younger kids
261900	157.583	159.641	-0.6666666865348816	35	 It can be a little scary
261900	156.456	158.583	0.3333333432674408	34	 There's a little bit of action
261900	149.073	157.456	1.6666666269302368	33	 And if you have a daughter or a son who is probably under the age of ten, I think they'd love it because there's some imaginary creatures
261900	147.386	149.803	-0.3333333432674408	32	 (uhh) It's definitely a little kid's movie
261902	136.551	140.025	-0.3333333432674408	24	 There wasn't anything new in terms of comedy
261902	139.025	144.146	-2.0	25	 No real humor that really got me rolling or anything like that
261902	144.024	146.181	-0.3333333432674408	26	 No special effects
261902	145.541	148.197	-0.6666666865348816	27	 Soundtrack is debatable
261902	112.576	116.998	-0.3333333432674408	20	 For instance, there's a movie called Road Trip, a movie called Eurotrip
261902	116.088	132.772	-0.6666666865348816	21	 And while those were all teenagers and, and (stutter) more a little about drugs and getting drunk and sex, it's still the kind of same humor, where people drive around and they say funny things and there's a parent you try to avoid because they will get you in trouble
261902	132.061	135.426	-0.6666666865348816	22	 And that just felt like the same thing for this movie
261902	134.985	137.551	-2.0	23	 Definitely not one of my favorites
261902	147.835	156.498	-1.3333333730697632	28	 (umm) There was one good song, many okay songs, and a couple songs I just wondered why they were even on the soundtrack, what a waste of my life
261902	156.835	161.127	-1.6666666269302368	29	 (umm) I'm only going to give this movie a two out of five stars for all of those reasons
261902	1.707	3.655	0.0	1	 This is Aub eighty four
261902	0.79	2.538	0.0	0	Hey, ExpoTV
261902	8.312	13.423	0.3333333432674408	3	 (umm) Before I go into character detail, I'll give you a little heads up about what the movie is about
261902	2.655	8.594	0.3333333432674408	2	 Today I'm going to talk about the movie College Road Trip, starring Martin Lawrence and Raven Symone
261902	22.59	31.612	0.0	5	 And he's very worried about the kind of trouble that she's going to get into when she's away at college (umm) you know, drugs, sex, parties, things like that
261902	12.872	23.231	0.0	4	 Martin Lawrence plays a police officer who decides to go on a road trip with his daughter, playing by Raven Symone, to check out colleges
261902	45.578	48.603	0.0	7	 (umm) Many of you will recognize Raven Symone
261902	30.831	45.201	0.0	6	 So basically the movie revolves around how he tries to keep her away from these kinds of things while they're on the road trip, and he definitely is trying to pick out a college that is clean and well-run and not going to lead her astray
261902	51.145	53.432	0.3333333432674408	9	 (uhh) She has a couple of movies out
261902	47.603	51.886	0.0	8	 She was a child actor on a lot of TV shows
261902	55.775	68.189	1.3333333730697632	11	 (umm) Obviously, she's of college age for this movie, and I think she does a much better job of acting now than she did when she was a kid, (uhh) maybe understandable, a little more training, a little more experience could do a lot
261902	52.432	56.356	0.6666666865348816	10	 And I was actually surprised to see how much she's grown up
261902	77.046	82.366	-0.6666666865348816	13	 (umm) I would say that if you've seen a Martin Lawrence comedy, you've seen this movie
261902	67.737	77.118	0.3333333432674408	12	 (uhh) Martin Lawrence is in his typical role, kind of a wise-cracking humor (umm) lots of situational gags, some physical comedy
261902	83.282	94.11	1.3333333730697632	15	 (uhh) One of the best parts of the movie is a scene where (umm) Martin Lawrence's character finds these coffee beans and he thinks they're drugs
261902	81.616	83.663	0.0	14	 It's very similar
261902	97.889	103.568	0.0	17	 So that was kind of a situational, physical, ha, ha, ha bit
261902	93.419	98.629	0.0	16	 And so he feeds them to this pig and the pig goes crazy on caffeine
261902	105.921	113.576	-0.6666666865348816	19	 I guess there's just not much that hasn't been done for kind of the college road trip type deal
261902	102.568	106.342	0.3333333432674408	18	 And that was one of the funnier scenes of the movie, unfortunately
261902	163.28	166.016	-1.3333333730697632	31	 Don't rush out to see it in the theaters
261902	160.297	164.28	-1.3333333730697632	30	 If you do have to see it, I would say rent it
262165	153.692	156.727	2.3333332538604736	24	 And (uhh) this is by far my favorite one
262165	155.727	163.233	1.6666666269302368	25	 I think this was the last one that (uhh) that me and my friends in (uhh) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, watched before I moved to Chicago
262165	162.502	168.082	-2.0	26	 And (uhh) I have fond memories of watching this tremendous piece of crap with (uhh) my friends before moving
262165	132.021	139.886	-0.3333333432674408	20	 I, I (stutter) honestly think that they just used a body double for him so that he did not have to be in the same room with anyone else
262165	138.886	141.732	-0.6666666865348816	21	 And I think they just shot his coverage separately
262165	141.44	143.707	-0.6666666865348816	22	 It just has that feel to it
262165	144.124	154.263	-1.0	23	 (umm) Yeah, this is a, a really stupid movie, and me and my friends used to get together and (umm) watch really awful movies like this and just talk over them and make fun of them
262165	1.169	4.164	0.0	1	 Playing over my shoulder is this
262165	0.0	1.6	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, everyone
262165	5.379	7.686	-2.6666667461395264	3	 This is a terrible movie
262165	3.593	5.461	0.0	2	 This is Freejack
262165	20.754	25.585	-0.6666666865348816	5	 He (uhh) lifted (uhh) large elements of the plot
262165	8.362	21.375	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (umm) I first heard of this movie (uhh) when a friend of mine in grade school decided to (uhh) rip off its storyline for a (uhh) short story that he had written (uhh) in grade school
262165	30.881	51.736	0.0	7	 And (uhh) (uhh) this movie storyline and his storyline are as follows: (uhh) Emilio Estevez plays a race car driver who (umm) just as he is about to die in a (uhh) horrible race car driving accident, he, his (stutter) body is snatched into the future, (uhh) thanks to (uhh) a billionaire Anthony Hopkins
262165	25.064	31.253	-0.3333333432674408	6	 And (uhh) as he was explaining this in front of the class, I thought to myself, huh, that sounds an awful lot like Freejack
262165	64.475	71.322	0.0	9	 (umm) Also in this movie is Rene Russo, who was in Lethal Weapons three and four, and the Thomas Crown Affair
262165	51.265	63.779	-1.3333333730697632	8	 And (umm) the reason Anthony Hopkins' character does that is so he can take his (uhh) mind and implant it into the body of Emilio Estevez's character, thus giving him eternal life or some nonsense
262165	80.568	83.673	-2.3333332538604736	11	 And his performance is terrible in this movie
262165	70.86	81.468	0.0	10	 And (uhh) also in this movie, in addition to her, is (umm) Mick Jagger here, who was in The Rolling Stones and still is in The Rolling Stones
262165	89.678	94.229	-0.3333333432674408	13	 (uhh) Anthony Hopkins is in this movie very, very barely
262165	84.41	88.672	-0.3333333432674408	12	 (umm) He has one facial expression, and it pretty much consists of this
262165	101.301	107.878	0.0	15	 He communicates with Rene Russo's character (uhh) via a (uhh) telecommunications device
262165	94.467	101.902	-1.0	14	 (umm) I think for like the first half of the movie, at the very least, he's not even in the same room with any of the other main characters
262165	110.76	116.489	-2.0	17	 And the backdrop is just some mad painting and it looks terrible
262165	107.168	111.76	-1.0	16	 And he's (uhh) either in, like, China or (uhh) France or something
262165	120.088	132.073	-0.3333333432674408	19	 I honestly think that in, in (stutter) like the final third of the movie, or whatever, in the latter half of the movie, I actually think it's more like the final third or the final quarter, when he actually is in the same room with Emilio Estevez and Rene Russo
262165	115.988	121.088	-2.0	18	 And (umm) he really, really, sincerely, honestly phoned in his performance
262226	29.395	38.237	-2.0	11	 All right? All right, now, all right, the acting was okay, but the writing wasn't good, and there's nothing new about the screen shots, the cinematography
262226	27.968	30.395	-2.0	10	 The writing even wasn't that good
262226	40.27	43.066	-3.0	13	 There is not one reason to see this movie
262226	37.237	41.1	-2.6666667461395264	12	 All right? There's, like, no reason to see it
262226	51.325	54.49	-2.6666667461395264	15	 Go do something else, because this movie is not good
262226	42.405	52.325	-2.6666667461395264	14	 In my opinion, I think you could spend your money and, more importantly, your time elsewhere or in a different (stutter) movie in the theater, or don't even go to movies
262226	58.349	63.3	-2.0	17	 And Tyler Perry, this is a message from me to you
262226	53.939	59.0	-2.6666667461395264	16	 All right? Seriously, whoever cast this movie, not good
262226	64.565	67.77	-2.3333332538604736	19	 Everyone on ExpoTV, please do not see this movie
262226	62.3	65.195	-2.3333332538604736	18	 Do not make movies, because they're not good
262226	3.803	9.263	-2.0	1	 All right? First of all, Tyler Perry, quit making stuff
262226	0.0	4.803	0.6666666865348816	0	ExpoTV, let's talk about Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns
262226	10.208	11.937	-1.6666666269302368	3	 You're not funny
262226	8.312	10.879	-0.3333333432674408	2	 Quit making TV shows
262226	11.904	13.513	-3.0	5	 It's stupid
262226	10.937	12.904	-2.0	4	 No one thinks you're funny
262226	14.109	21.505	-3.0	7	 All right? Now, the premise of the movie, Meet the Browns, is extremely stupid
262226	12.513	15.109	-2.6666667461395264	6	 Let me tell you why
262226	25.104	28.299	-2.0	9	 All right? The acting was not that good
262226	66.77	69.067	-2.0	20	 It's not worth your time
262226	21.063	26.084	-2.3333332538604736	8	 I highly recommend going to see anything except for this movie
264418	107.437	117.467	-1.6666666269302368	11	 It was about two hours and forty minutes long and it just (uhh) I just became less and less invested in it as time progressed and (umm) it was, it was (stutter) just an okay movie
264418	105.641	108.437	-2.3333332538604736	10	 It it (stutter) just, the movie just went on and on
264418	119.21	121.687	-1.3333333730697632	13	 There are better movies by Spielberg
264418	116.467	120.21	-1.6666666269302368	12	 So I I (stutter) really, I I (stutter) don't really recommend it
264418	125.586	128.512	-1.3333333730697632	15	 But yeah, this was just (uhh)
264418	120.687	126.197	0.3333333432674408	14	 Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, any of the Indiana Jones movies although that's like comparing apples and oranges
264418	0.979	3.975	0.3333333432674408	1	 Playing over my shoulder is this movie
264418	0.0	1.51	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello everyone
264418	6.586	22.732	0.0	3	 (uhh) It stars Eric Bana as a (uhh) the the (stutter) leader of a group of (uhh) Israelis who are given the task of killing the eleven Palestinians who (uhh) were responsible for the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Munich massacre of (uhh) eleven Israeli athletes
264418	2.975	6.758	0.0	2	 This is Munich which was directed by Steven Spielberg
264418	27.788	34.864	-1.6666666269302368	5	 It (uhh) really didn't (uhh) involve me at any kind of, you know, serious emotional level
264418	22.161	28.788	-2.0	4	 It was based on the (uhh) book Vengeance by George Jonas and (uhh) I really didn't like this movie that much
264418	52.702	87.854	-2.0	7	 (umm) That that (stutter) revelation really didn't blow me away that they were feeling that way and (umm) and I I (stutter) have a personal rule that if (uhh), you know, you don't really know the names of characters you can't really get that involved with them, and in all honesty the only two people whose names I remember from this movie are Avner who was (uhh) Eric Bana's character and Carl who was played (uhh) (umm) by (uhh) Ciaran Hinds (uhh) in this movie and (umm) I really didn't (uhh) I I (stutter) like I I (stutter) really didn't have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters in this movie
264418	35.132	51.846	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) It's supposed to be about the (uhh) the toll that murder takes on, you know, normal people and (uhh) again, I I (stutter) like I just it didn't really surprise me that these people were experiencing regret that they were killing, you know, people even though those people themselves (uhh) may have deserved it
264418	90.286	106.641	-1.3333333730697632	9	 (uhh) Geoffrey Rush is in it and (uhh) he was alright and (umm) Daniel Craig who was James Bond is also in the movie but (uhh) there there (stutter) were some genuine moments of like tension and excitement and (uhh) but in all honesty it really didn't add up to much for me
264418	87.303	90.668	-1.0	8	 (umm) I I (stutter) was really unaffected by it
264446	172.06	180.084	-1.6666666269302368	28	 (uhh) They're homosexual in real life and so that aids them in playing gay men, but I don't think they embody their characters well enough
264446	179.114	183.187	-1.0	29	 They don't make you feel like they're actually who they say they are
264446	193.452	199.999	-1.0	32	" Why aren't they going to, you know, work hard for me?"" And I think you'll get that a lot in this movie"
264446	147.027	153.325	-0.3333333432674408	23	 (umm) There is a little bit of race issue in this, too, because one of the guys is white and one of the guys is a minority
264446	152.355	162.135	0.3333333432674408	24	 So it's interesting to see not only are they gay and struggling to deal with that, with each other, they're also (uhh), you know, the race issue comes into play a couple of times, as well
264446	161.415	164.171	0.0	25	 So there's kind of a lot of dynamics going on here
264446	163.709	170.716	-1.3333333730697632	26	 (umm) One one (stutter) of the main things I didn't like about the movie is that the two main actors aren't very good
264446	169.716	172.472	-1.0	27	 I don't think they get into their roles enough
264446	128.958	135.206	-1.0	20	 There is a lot of profanity in this movie, (umm) so if you're worried about that I wouldn't see it
264446	134.356	138.269	0.6666666865348816	21	 (uhh) Not a lot of overtly sexual content
264446	137.848	146.71	0.0	22	 (umm) Obviously, you're going to see a bunch of good looking guys in in various states of undress, but not any, you know, graphic sexual depictions, or anything like that
264446	264.191	272.644	-1.3333333730697632	49	 (umm) But if you don't mind that kind of thing, and you're into a little light discussion about how, you know, a gay couple tries to make things work, you might be mildly entertained
264446	253.545	256.331	-1.0	46	 There's nothing that you're going to miss
264446	255.76	258.506	-0.6666666865348816	47	 (uhh) And you're gonna save a few bucks, as well
264446	251.49	253.827	-1.0	44	 Don't worry about seeing this in theater
264446	252.827	254.545	-0.6666666865348816	45	 Rent this one
264446	243.418	250.205	-1.3333333730697632	42	 I would have liked to see it with a more well known lead actor, (umm) who really wanted to get into the role
264446	249.205	252.25	-2.0	43	 I'm only going to give this a one of five star
264446	233.92	242.842	-0.3333333432674408	40	 And the two main actors (uhh) actually were writers of this movie as well, so it makes me think, that it's not that they weren't into the movie, it's just kinda how they act
264446	241.842	244.049	-1.3333333730697632	41	 Which is kinda disappointing
264446	9.42	14.79	-0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) This is a more independent film, so many of you won't be able to find it at your major theaters
264446	0.0	9.811	0.0	0	Hey, expo tv, this is Aubs eighty four and tonight I'm going to give a review of the movie A Four Letter Word, which is currently in theaters
264446	19.407	21.575	0.0	3	 It it's (stutter) a gay movie
264446	14.109	19.589	0.0	2	 If you have an independent or unaffiliated theater near you, this is where you're going to find this movie
264446	28.686	33.138	0.0	5	 It starts out where one of the guys is kinda macho man
264446	20.894	29.327	-0.3333333432674408	4	 It follows the story of a two gay gentlemen who end up (uhh) hooking up and trying to make a relationship work
264446	34.653	36.86	0.0	7	 He sleeps around a lot
264446	32.138	35.653	0.0	6	 He's (uhh) he's (stutter) all about the guys
264446	37.217	39.574	-1.0	9	 He's afraid of commitment
264446	35.86	38.217	0.0	8	 He's never been tied down
264446	227.893	234.072	-1.0	39	 I don't know th if this is, you know, how they are in all their movies, or if they just weren't into this movie
264446	224.122	228.893	0.0	38	 (uhh) I haven't seen any other movies with either of them in it, so I don't know what they're normally like
264446	40.809	45.63	0.3333333432674408	11	 And he's got a lot of (uhh), you know, friends with him who kinda do much of the same
264446	38.963	41.28	0.0	10	 He's just out to have a good time
264446	51.125	57.673	0.0	13	 He's, you know, all about lovey-dovey, commitment, relationship and the two end up falling in love together
264446	45.029	52.125	0.3333333432674408	12	 However, one time he goes into a bar and he meets this guy, and his name is Stephen, who is exact opposite
264446	68.186	80.571	0.0	15	 It deals with a lot of homosexual issues (umm) in terms of acceptance and they try to deal with love in their own way and how the mainstream doesn't really accept that a lot of times
264446	57.82	68.877	0.0	14	 (umm) The story is mostly about how they try to deal with being in a monogamous relationship (uhh) when the one guy kinda isn't very used to that
264446	94.846	105.703	0.3333333432674408	17	 It it (stutter) pretends as though it's just a normal couple who are doing a normal thing and never mind that they're homosexual, they're just out trying to (umm), you know, have a loving relationship and go on
264446	81.396	95.467	0.3333333432674408	16	 (umm) While while (stutter) the homosexual aspect is kind of brought up in this movie, and it it (stutter) is influenced (umm) by the mainstream, most of the movie focuses just on the two guys' relationship and how they try to make it work
264446	199.219	204.419	-1.3333333730697632	33	 A supporting cast, I would say is equal to that or even worse
264446	105.681	121.976	1.0	18	 I think that's kind of refreshing actually because (uhh) I found (uhh) a lot of the homosexual movies focus too much on, you know, the idea that they're being persecuted or that it's so hard to be gay in today's society or, you know, they're always looked down upon and they struggle through life
264446	191.486	194.452	-0.6666666865348816	31	" You're left like, ""Well I paid good money for this"
264446	183.534	192.486	-1.0	30	 (umm) If you've been left feeling empty by other movies before, you know what that feels like when a character doesn't sell it right you kinda, you know, you're left hallow
264446	219.542	224.533	-1.6666666269302368	37	 But you will notice the main actors just kinda not flowing very well together
264446	215.252	220.203	-1.3333333730697632	36	 (uhh) Maybe if you haven't seen as many movies, you won't notice some of the supporting actors being bored
264446	210.693	215.733	-0.3333333432674408	35	 And I, if you've seen a lot of movies, you kinda know what that looks like and you can kinda pick up on that
264446	204.008	211.254	-1.3333333730697632	34	 (uhh) Some scenes, I've see, I mean guys looking off just kinda bored and like they're not even wanting to be part of this movie
264446	121.385	128.532	-1.0	19	 And this movie, while it kind of hints at that a little bit, it's definitely not its main focus and it it's (stutter) barely touched upon, actually
264446	258.215	264.413	-0.6666666865348816	48	 (umm) If you don't like gay movies, if you don't like the homosexual issue, obviously, this isn't gonna be a movie for you
265959	99.276	108.108	-2.3333332538604736	11	 (uhh) I don't know where he got the idea for this, but it really is absolutely terrible
265959	89.079	99.557	-2.0	10	 (uhh) So I really would not bother with with (stutter) You Don't Mess With the Zohan at all, like, not even on DVD, absolutely nothing
265959	112.486	120.021	-2.6666667461395264	13	 But, like but like (stutter) the story and the whole plot, it was just absolutely terrible
265959	108.076	113.176	-0.6666666865348816	12	 (uhh) It has, like, the same cast as all his other movies, like, Rob Schneider, people like that
265959	125.007	127.753	-2.6666667461395264	15	 Do not see this movie
265959	119.28	125.379	-2.3333332538604736	14	 So (uhh) I would have to give You Don't Mess With the Zohan (uhh) one out of five
265959	126.753	128.831	-2.3333332538604736	16	 Please don't see it
265959	6.676	10.55	0.0	1	 (uhh) It's starring, I guess, Adam Sandler
265959	0.311	6.878	0.0	0	What's up, ExpoTV? I saw a movie called Don't You Don't Mess With the Zohan
265959	15.666	22.253	-2.3333332538604736	3	 It was absolutely terrible, probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters
265959	10.029	16.187	-2.6666667461395264	2	 And (uhh) you really don't want to even mess with this movie, to be completely honest
265959	48.581	55.976	-2.0	5	 (uhh) It's supposed to be, like, one of those, like, I guess outrageously funny movies, and it really, like, wasn't
265959	22.151	48.294	0.0	4	 (uhh) It's it's it's (stutter) about how how (stutter) this guy, he's, like, this, like, secret agent, but he fakes his own death, and he moves to New York City and (uhh) he wants to be, like, a hair stylist, but then he also still has, like, his, like, spy skills, where he can, like, beat people up, like like (stutter) crazy, in crazy ways and stuff
265959	59.815	72.619	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) Like that trailer (uhh) he kicks people really weird that's, like, not realistic, like, he's supposed to be, like, this super super (stutter) agent, super hair stylist
265959	55.126	60.277	-0.6666666865348816	6	 The the (stutter) preview pretty much shows you what the whole movie is
265959	78.034	88.682	-2.0	9	 I I (stutter) thought that, like, Adam Sandler was starting to make better movies, but, like, he's definitely gotten worse and worse
265959	71.619	79.034	-1.6666666269302368	8	 And it's just like, kind of like making fun of, like (stutter), everyone, but it's, like, really stupid
266366	118.951	129.26	-1.6666666269302368	11	 Another thing I noticed (uhh) was the animation part, it seems that they have just focused on the bodies of these two you know the Hulk and the evil guy
266366	114.531	119.392	-2.0	10	 (umm) Because I thought of it as action packed, it was not
266366	132.71	135.566	-2.0	13	 The animations was really poor
266366	128.739	133.71	-0.3333333432674408	12	 The rest and you know, the blast and the helicopter crashes and what not
266366	139.345	148.666	-2.0	15	 Like I would expect this kind of animations back in the nineteen-nineties but it is two-thousand eight and no one expect that kind of animations
266366	134.566	140.175	-2.0	14	 Like you can tell its, its (stutter) computer animated and it's really bad
266366	149.661	158.523	-2.0	17	 (uhh) The the (stutter) direction was okay and the acting was okay but the story line was (uhh) (stutter) The story just didn't move at all
266366	147.666	149.953	-2.0	16	 It was really disappointing
266366	157.523	164.021	-2.3333332538604736	18	 It, it (stutter) was just there and it was like you know they could have ended the movie in ten minutes if they wanted to
266366	0.42	6.309	0.0	1	 (uhh) Today I am reviewing the movie Incredible Hulk which is currently playing in theaters nationwide
266366	0.0	0.902	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
266366	21.862	38.287	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) I think that would be the biggest mistake that I've done this year of actually going to watch watch (stutter) this movie and (uhh) let me tell you this again that you know all these movies that are coming out in summer (umm) you know which are really anticipated and what not
266366	6.028	22.323	0.0	2	 (uhh) Now Incredible Hulk is a sequel to the movie, The Hulk and (uhh) let me tell you I wasn't a big fan of The Hulk but I saw all these trailers of Incredible Hulk and it looked so much action packed that I decided to go watch this movie
266366	48.122	63.35	0.3333333432674408	5	 So Hulk ended somewhere that you know so he he's (stutter) (uhh) kinda running away from the army and what not so this movie starts that this guy now wants to cure himself and (uhh) he's not in North America anymore
266366	37.287	49.082	-2.0	4	 I am sure Incredible Hulk is the worst of all of those which have already released and which are going to release again so it's really bad and let me tell you why
266366	67.179	90.628	-1.3333333730697632	7	 And (uhh) out of whatever less than two hours movie, only ten minutes is when you know the hulk is actually on the screen, the rest, it's this guy planning how to, kind of you know, get away, cure himself (uhh) from being the hulk because that's basically his heart rate goes up and he turns into the hulk
266366	62.35	67.45	0.0	6	 He's somewhere in Central America hiding away from the army because they still want him
266366	109.742	114.334	-2.6666667461395264	9	 I was sleeping forty minutes into the movie, was that boring
266366	90.576	110.742	-2.3333332538604736	8	 (uhh) Another thing that the trailers showed was was (stutter) another guy, (umm) you know the size of hulk and looked really evil and I waited pretty much the entire movie for this guy to show up and he just showed up for the last ten, fifteen minutes and I I (stutter) pretty much slept in the movie you know
266396	76.418	80.84	-1.3333333730697632	24	 And I know a lot of movies are an hour and a half, but this one was really cut down
266396	79.84	82.486	0.0	25	 It could have, it could have (stutter) gone on for two hours
266396	81.486	84.971	-2.0	26	 And I think that's what it should have been, but it wasn't
266396	83.971	86.816	-2.3333332538604736	27	 I mean, it was, that was a complete disappointment
266396	63.477	66.802	-0.6666666865348816	20	 I could probably go on for, like, ten minutes about it, but I can't
266396	67.149	73.257	-1.6666666269302368	21	 (umm) I'm going to tell you really fast why that's all bad and, like I said, the best part about the movie was just the idea
266396	73.774	76.26	-1.6666666269302368	22	 (umm) Even the, even (stutter) how long it was
266396	75.26	77.418	-0.6666666865348816	23	 It was only an hour and a half
266396	86.195	90.089	-2.6666667461395264	28	 You also don't care about the characters in the movie, if they die or not
266396	89.089	90.418	-2.0	29	 You don't
266396	0.311	3.775	0.0	0	There are two types of people in this world people who like M
266396	8.183	11.587	-0.3333333432674408	4	 This is a completely unbiased review against M
266396	15.337	18.911	-2.0	8	 The Village and Lady in the Water were complete letdowns for me
266396	163.48	167.214	-0.6666666865348816	59	 Even, even, (stutter) another thing I just wanted to end with
266396	162.253	164.48	-2.6666667461395264	58	 I really can't say anything good about the movie
266396	154.38	156.707	-2.6666667461395264	55	 It wasn't realistic at all
266396	149.741	155.38	-2.0	54	 Dialog, delivery, and just the dialog had a, how you wrote it, it was absolutely awful
266396	159.828	163.253	-1.3333333730697632	57	 (uhh) What else? {Sigh} I, I'm (stutter) sorry
266396	156.316	160.0	-2.6666667461395264	56	 (umm) It was so bad, it was absolutely terrible
266396	141.21	143.408	-2.3333332538604736	51	 It was, it was (stutter) laughable
266396	140.572	142.21	-0.3333333432674408	50	 You really didn't
266396	143.445	150.292	-2.3333332538604736	53	 And the, the dialog was probably one of the, if not the worst part of the movie, besides the acting, which was really bad
266396	142.408	144.136	-1.0	52	 It really was
266396	233.401	235.967	-1.0	88	 But I can't
266396	235.556	237.105	-2.0	89	 I can't
266396	221.817	223.585	0.0	82	 Not after this movie
266396	222.585	225.192	-1.0	83	 I doubt I'm going to see any more of his movies
266396	219.193	220.852	-0.6666666865348816	80	 And I am an M
266396	219.852	222.817	-1.0	81	 Night Shyamalan fan, well, at least I was
266396	228.712	233.064	-1.3333333730697632	86	 And I will, I really wish I couldn't say that, because I do love the guy
266396	232.064	234.062	0.0	87	 Like I said, I did
266396	224.601	227.846	-1.0	84	 The only reason I'd recommend seeing this movie is probably to laugh
266396	226.846	229.392	-1.0	85	 And that's, that's (stutter) completely honest
266396	7.055	9.183	0.0	3	 I am one who does
266396	12.653	16.017	2.6666667461395264	7	 I mean, I loved his first three films
266396	110.011	112.678	-2.6666667461395264	39	 Zooey (stutter) Deschanel, just stop
266396	108.804	110.353	-1.3333333730697632	38	 That's sad
266396	99.974	101.892	-1.0	33	 And I'm sorry, Santa
266396	94.417	100.705	-2.6666667461395264	32	 Okay? And you think he's going to be, like, this awesome actor, but, you know, this is his worst performance of his career
266396	92.541	95.417	-0.3333333432674408	31	 The, (stutter) Mark Wahlberg is in this movie
266396	89.418	91.945	-1.3333333730697632	30	 I mean, I could go on forever, but sorry
266396	106.549	109.804	0.0	37	 He's probably the best one, best best (stutter) actor in the movie
266396	103.566	107.37	-2.0	36	 It's the worst performance of his career, but yet he holds the movie up
266396	102.179	104.147	-2.0	35	 And that's very sad
266396	100.892	103.179	0.3333333432674408	34	 And he holds the movie up
266396	166.533	169.638	-2.3333332538604736	60	 You think it's going to be a scary movie, but it's not
266396	168.858	175.415	0.0	61	 There's only one scene where you're holding onto your seat and you're about to, you know, like, those scenes where you're waiting to jump? There's only one of them
266396	174.415	176.113	-1.0	62	 There's only one scene
266396	175.113	177.311	-1.3333333730697632	63	 It doesn't even last that long
266396	176.59	181.032	-1.6666666269302368	64	 And you think, well, it's R-rated, so there's going to be a lot of gore, right? There's no gore
266396	180.172	182.22	-2.0	65	 There's absolutely no gore
266396	181.22	185.293	-1.3333333730697632	66	 Every time you think you're about to see gore, it just cuts to a new scene
266396	184.462	186.34	-1.3333333730697632	67	 You don't see anything
266396	185.34	188.435	-1.3333333730697632	68	 I've seen more gore in the trailer of this movie
266396	187.844	189.912	-3.0	69	 Okay? It's pathetic
266396	5.419	7.586	0.0	2	 Night Shyamalan films
266396	10.847	13.653	1.6666666269302368	6	 I actually loved his first three films
266396	237.083	239.22	-3.0	91	 I can't say anything good about it
266396	236.105	238.083	-1.0	90	 I really cannot recommend this movie
266396	239.906	241.874	-1.0	93	 It is laughable
266396	238.22	240.627	-3.0	92	 So do not go see this movie
266396	243.079	244.388	-1.0	95	 Okay
266396	241.173	243.74	-2.6666667461395264	94	 You are seriously wasting your money
266396	244.326	246.404	-3.0	97	 It is, is that bad
266396	243.468	245.286	-1.0	96	 You seriously are
266396	27.07	29.517	-3.0	11	 The movie was absolutely terrible
266396	25.753	28.07	-1.0	10	 And I think that's the way it's going to be
266396	34.064	40.561	1.0	13	 (umm) The idea, as far-fetched as it is in the movie, is probably the best part of the movie
266396	29.085	33.946	-2.0	12	 It wasn't, like, the worst movie ever made, like some people are saying, but it was pretty awful
266396	42.664	57.872	-3.0	15	 But everything about the movie, the dialog, the acting, the casting (umm), the pace, the tone, the plot, where it goes, the scary moments, the gore, all that that I just named is awful
266396	39.841	43.664	1.0	14	 The idea he came up with for the movie, that was probably the best part
266396	57.78	59.598	-2.3333332538604736	17	 It is just awful
266396	56.992	58.69	-3.0	16	 It is just awful
266396	61.033	64.098	-0.6666666865348816	19	 And I wish I could I could (stutter) talk longer
266396	59.077	62.033	0.0	18	 Now, I have to make this review kind of short
266396	133.608	136.194	-0.6666666865348816	48	 (stutter) Just take more time on your movies
266396	135.194	141.322	-2.3333332538604736	49	 You seriously, this could have been, had so much more potential and it went nowhere and you didn't care
266396	129.637	131.136	-2.0	46	 Seriously
266396	130.225	134.408	-1.6666666269302368	47	 Come out with a movie every three years, maybe every four years even
266396	125.227	129.809	-0.6666666865348816	44	 (umm) The storyline and the way it was written, like I said, the idea was good, but M
266396	128.809	130.637	-2.3333332538604736	45	 Night Shyamalan, take a break
266396	113.144	118.395	-3.0	42	 Just take a year off and get your head together, because that, that (stutter) movie, it was just absolutely terrible
266396	117.395	124.491	-3.0	43	 Your dialog, delivery, and everything about what you did, everything, everything about what you did was absolutely terrible
266396	111.807	113.196	-2.0	40	 Just stop
266396	112.196	114.144	-2.0	41	 I don't even know what to say about you
266396	2.775	6.419	0.0	1	 Night Shyamalan films and people who do not like M
266396	10.587	11.847	0.0	5	 Night Shyamalan
266396	17.911	26.753	-3.0	9	 And I said to myself, if this one, The Happening, is not as good as his first three, I am going to say I'm not going to go see his movies anymore
266396	211.81	214.905	-1.6666666269302368	77	 Okay? You do not, Mark Wahlberg, he's not a science teacher
266396	209.595	212.62	-0.3333333432674408	76	 Okay? Because he's a science teacher
266396	207.5	210.595	-1.6666666269302368	75	 He should not play this character at all
266396	205.524	208.5	-1.0	74	 And then, he doesn't play this character at all
266396	200.675	206.195	-2.3333332538604736	73	 I'm not saying Mark Wahlberg is not a good actor, because he is, but, first of all, not in this movie
266396	199.518	201.436	-1.6666666269302368	72	 And the casting
266396	195.617	200.518	-1.6666666269302368	71	 All those reasons, plus a million more (umm) that makes this movie so bad
266396	189.84	196.617	-2.6666667461395264	70	 (umm) I really, you know, like I said, I really wish I could go on forever about this movie, but, in a nutshell, I do not recommend this movie
266396	217.417	220.193	-2.0	79	 So I do not recommend seeing this movie
266396	214.644	218.108	-1.3333333730697632	78	 And it doesn't matter that it's a movie, we're not going to believe that
266852	191.676	211.244	-0.3333333432674408	24	 Because the movie (umm) yeah, the most important thing I wanna share about this is that the starting of the movie, it just happened like real fun that something is happening, something is happening it's not like you set a bag down and then start on the storyline
266852	210.792	216.951	0.3333333432674408	25	 So and in the first scene they have shown that something is happening to the city
266852	215.951	221.43	0.0	26	 And so that scene is continued to the end of the movie
266852	221.318	226.629	-0.6666666865348816	27	 So as I say I'm gonna give this movie two out of five
266852	147.386	164.769	0.0	20	 (umm) So this movie (umm) like, I do not want to disclose the suspense but there is a bit of suspense in this movie (umm) that this, only this guy was saved just from the whole northeast coast just so the guy was like
266852	164.408	176.882	0.0	21	 and then after sometime like xxx show up that this guy's letting his (umm) regular life and then the same thing happens some other place
266852	177.418	181.042	0.0	22	 (umm) That's that's (stutter) the point where the movie ends
266852	180.691	191.568	-0.6666666865348816	23	 So in this movie (umm) I would just say that (umm) probably gonna give this movie like a two out of five
266852	2.885	7.716	0.0	1	 (umm) Today I'll be reviewing the movie The Happening
266852	1.827	3.496	0.0	0	Hi guys
266852	12.762	16.386	0.0	3	 Night Shyamalan and written by M
266852	7.834	13.762	0.0	2	 (umm) This movie just released this week and it's been directed by M
266852	16.903	20.707	-0.3333333432674408	5	 And so most of you know M
266852	15.386	17.274	0.0	4	 Night Shyamalan
266852	26.741	31.642	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) But he also made some movies like the Lady In Water
266852	19.707	27.511	0.0	6	 Night Shyamalan he's famous for some movie like (umm) the one of the great escape, (umm) Sixth Sense
266852	43.203	52.514	-1.3333333730697632	9	 (umm) So xxx I just, I went to the theater to watch this movie and let me firstly tell you it's not that good movie
266852	31.161	44.113	-0.6666666865348816	8	 So I, so in my mind it cause kind of mixed feeling like whether it's gonna be like (umm) The Sign or it's gonna be like The Happening
266852	59.376	70.314	0.0	11	 Because (umm) in all the movie you are just like (umm) they they're (stutter) gonna open suspense, they're gonna open the suspense now, now, now but
266852	52.083	59.848	-1.6666666269302368	10	 If I were rate Sixth Sense as a ten out of ten I would give this movie just like two out of ten
266852	76.777	89.919	0.0	13	 So in this movie (umm) the main leading character a science teacher played by Eric Moore (umm) the character Erik Moore is being playing by Mark Wahlberg
266852	70.332	77.138	-0.6666666865348816	12	 (umm) To a standard movie for still like a misleading (umm) a storyline
266852	93.559	110.473	-0.3333333432674408	15	 (umm) In this movie he is shown as a science teacher and to his point of the (stutter) amusement that (umm) he found that something strange is happening all around the northeast (umm) coast of the country
266852	89.578	92.823	0.0	14	 And he is the main leading character
266852	115.08	135.965	0.3333333432674408	17	 (umm) So in the movie you see like (umm) something return two or three and depressing xxx say totally sharp so if you are taking your children be careful because there are gonna be some scenes which could be like, so many people dead lying on the street or hanging on the tree
266852	110.889	115.062	-0.6666666865348816	16	 (umm) So they they (stutter) cannot figure out what's actually happening
266852	143.645	146.361	-0.6666666865348816	19	 So warning for that
266852	134.965	144.146	-1.3333333730697632	18	 So that's a little scary and you don't you don't (stutter) want your children to look at those (umm) scenes
266938	179.713	182.19	-3.0	42	 Don't even waste renting it on DVD
266938	84.859	87.615	-1.0	22	 For twenty-four hours and that's it
266938	181.21	184.474	-1.3333333730697632	43	 If it comes on cable, see it then
266938	221.747	223.416	-1.6666666269302368	53	 Night Shyamalan again
266938	218.016	222.608	-1.6666666269302368	52	 (umm) And Zoey I've got hope for you, but don't trust M
266938	86.814	101.972	-2.3333332538604736	23	 They're just running away from wind because it's carrying, well there's actually no real (stutter) explanation really but they think the trees are trying to poison them because it makes the part of their brain, some chemical part in their brain shut off (umm) so they all kill themselves
266938	101.291	103.349	0.0	24	 So I think what M
266938	102.349	110.333	-1.6666666269302368	25	 Night Shyamalan really wanted to do was make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways possible, because that's all this was
266938	109.443	112.219	-2.0	26	 And it wasn't even that gory, like
266938	111.219	119.382	-2.3333332538604736	27	 It could have been so much more, it really could have been but Mark Wahlberg just killed it, he killed it
266938	80.818	83.424	-0.6666666865348816	20	 It's people running away from wind
266938	83.661	85.0	0.3333333432674408	21	 Yup
266938	200.416	203.94	-1.0	48	 Night Shyamalan because I don't know
266938	202.94	209.887	-3.0	49	 He must have a stroke or something between films because this is just so bad I don't know why he thought this would be a good idea
266938	189.122	193.823	-3.0	46	 I give it one star because it's the lowest I can go but if I could go lower I would
266938	193.392	201.156	-2.6666667461395264	47	 The Happening, don't see it, it will waste your time and it will make you so sad for everyone involved, especially M
266938	184.283	188.176	-3.0	44	 That's all I can say, don't do not (stutter) see this movie
266938	187.176	189.902	-1.0	45	 There's nothing more I can say
266938	118.382	122.356	-2.0	28	 It, he was so unreal in this movie
266938	121.765	128.192	-0.6666666865348816	29	 I mean even in one part an old lady's like, you're gonna kill me in my sleep and he's like, what, no
266938	167.301	176.552	-0.6666666865348816	40	 I was so psyched about it because I figured it was the comeback, it's the first R-rated movie, it's gonna be grotesque, it's gonna be twisted, it's gonna be awesome
266938	177.259	180.613	-3.0	41	 No, do not waste your money on this film
266938	3.683	8.395	-2.0	1	 (umm) This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that's not even a lie
266938	0.0	3.765	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey Expo TV, today I'm reviewing The Happening
266938	11.585	15.798	-2.0	3	 And I would have walked out of this one if I hadn't been praying for M
266938	7.395	12.216	-1.3333333730697632	2	 I've I've (stutter) seen a lot of really bad movies, I walked out of a couple movies
266938	18.629	26.194	-3.0	5	 (umm) Mark Wahlberg was terrible, he will never get a job after this hopefully, because he was so bad in this movie
266938	14.888	17.823	-0.6666666865348816	4	 Night Shyamalan to pull something at the very end
266938	26.122	33.637	-2.6666667461395264	7	 Night Shyamalan wanted this to be campy and like a two hour long Twilight Zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day
266938	25.533	27.122	0.0	6	 And M
266938	40.32	43.345	-0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) I know people are rooting for M
266938	33.585	40.571	-2.6666667461395264	8	 (umm) They were actually really good in Twilight Zone, this is this is (stutter) that was a insult to the Twilight Zone this is a terrible movie
266938	74.153	76.4	0.6666666865348816	18	 But you know what, that was okay
266938	165.435	168.301	-0.3333333432674408	39	 I was looking forward to this film all summer
266938	159.918	166.216	-1.6666666269302368	38	 He can get back into that, I don't know what's wrong with him why is he doing this, I'm really pissed off at this movie
266938	49.539	55.807	-2.3333332538604736	11	 He's just on, (stutter) he hit his peak at twenty-three years old, like this kid he he (stutter) doesn't know what he's doing any more
266938	42.345	50.539	-1.6666666269302368	10	 Night Shyamalan I know that you know, he hasn't made a movie since Lady In the Water, god forbid that movie too
266938	60.454	62.851	1.3333333730697632	13	 (uhh) Unbreakable was pretty good
266938	54.807	60.776	2.3333332538604736	12	 The Sixth Sense was a beautiful movie, it was a beautiful film I love that film
266938	64.405	69.376	-0.6666666865348816	15	 (uhh) And then there came The Village which was not great but it was still okay
266938	62.41	64.667	1.0	14	 (uhh) Signs, awesome
266938	70.9	74.804	-0.6666666865348816	17	 Night Shyamalan for that, we were like, oh it's the twist and then it came and you're like (uhh)
266938	68.516	71.9	0.0	16	 There was the twist there we counted on M
266938	76.318	81.628	-2.6666667461395264	19	 Mainly Lady In the Water which was just an atrocity, and The Happening was even worse
266938	145.93	150.112	-2.6666667461395264	32	 But even then don't go see it, don't even see it as a satire, it's not worth it
266938	139.963	146.002	-0.6666666865348816	31	 But like I said maybe he meant it to be really campy and really silly and if he did, good job
266938	127.192	140.614	-3.0	30	 Like come on, have some emotion, like, don't sound like me {laughter} sound like a man who's like (uhh) and Zoey Deschanel I like her too but she just did a very poor job in this movie
266938	209.535	218.098	-2.6666667461395264	51	 Night Shyamalan get your act together and Mark Wahlberg, (uhh) go back to Marky Mark that's what you gotta do but do not go back on film
266938	151.766	157.725	-1.6666666269302368	36	 Night Shyamalan has got to get back on track, we need another Signs, we need another Sixth Sense, we need another Unbreakable
266938	151.268	152.327	-2.6666667461395264	35	 M
266938	150.729	152.268	-3.0	34	 Terrible
266938	149.112	151.529	-3.0	33	 It's a terrible film
266938	156.805	160.569	1.0	37	 These were all great films, these were amazing films
266938	222.915	226.539	-3.0	54	 Okay, The Happening, do not see this film
266938	208.887	210.086	0.0	50	 M
267252	70.97	75.013	-1.3333333730697632	11	 So I thought it was kind of like weird
267252	67.448	71.581	-0.3333333432674408	10	 Because like, just something in the like, air or something
267252	78.952	85.699	0.3333333432674408	13	 (uhh) It was I guess it was like definitely along the lines of Signs and like Sixth Sense, of those movies
267252	74.263	77.388	1.3333333730697632	12	 But you but you (stutter) guys might like it
267252	86.864	94.399	-0.6666666865348816	15	 It was just like, a little bit more like violent and I guess that's why it they rated it R
267252	85.018	87.864	-1.0	14	 But it wasn't as good
267252	103.985	105.803	-2.0	17	 It's not good
267252	94.068	104.985	-1.6666666269302368	16	 But (uhh) it's not like scary, it doesn't really freak you out or, or nike huarache so myself so if you're looking to go see a scary movie, do not see this this (stutter) movie
267252	105.142	110.892	-1.6666666269302368	18	 So so so (stutter) I would have to give The Happening a two out of five
267252	2.246	7.327	0.6666666865348816	1	 (uhh) I have a review for a movie called The Happening
267252	0.141	2.578	0.3333333432674408	0	What's up expo tv
267252	10.288	15.868	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It's and it's (stutter) rated R for violent violent (stutter) images
267252	7.135	11.288	0.0	2	 (uhh) This movie recently came out about two weeks ago
267252	21.103	25.027	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) That's all I really recognize from the movie
267252	15.606	20.158	0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) It's like a, it's starring Mark Wahlberg
267252	34.184	48.623	0.3333333432674408	7	 And (uhh) the movie is about how there's this like, (stutter) parent, this like, random thing and just, (stutter) like threating off like like like (stutter) it, like basically every person
267252	24.296	34.725	-0.3333333432674408	6	 And it's from like the producer of (uhh) or, of like (uhh) Signs and this, (stutter) Sixth Sense
267252	58.688	68.169	-1.0	9	 (uhh) But it was interesting but it was like kind of like, this can't be happening like, what like, what's going on why are all these people just going crazy
267252	47.623	57.812	-1.6666666269302368	8	 And it's just making them do crazy stuff and like everyone's just like dying and stuff it's really, really weird
267255	81.277	86.846	-1.0	11	 So like this movie isn't supposed to be like a romantic comedy or something
267255	75.54	82.027	-0.6666666865348816	10	 It's like Mike Myers does stuff like Wayne's World and like Austin Powers and stuff
267255	91.204	95.337	-2.0	13	 I really don't like Mike Myers that much
267255	85.846	92.204	-1.6666666269302368	12	 It's like just like a, really dull comedy I thought
267255	97.839	111.42	-2.0	15	 And this movie it (stutter) should, like the trailer should not be getting as many like slots, like during commercials that it's it's (stutter) like, getting cause it's really not good
267255	94.337	98.53	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I think he's definitely overrated
267255	115.16	119.741	-0.6666666865348816	17	 It's not as good as like, it's not as good as Austin Powers or anything
267255	111.807	116.12	0.6666666865348816	16	 (uhh) But see it I guess, if you like Mike Myers
267255	122.473	133.82	0.6666666865348816	19	 (uhh) A couple cameo like appearances from from (stutter) players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and from the Los Angeles Kings so check it out if you want to
267255	119.28	122.326	0.0	18	 But (uhh) It's called The Love Guru
267255	2.725	10.39	0.3333333432674408	1	 I have a (stutters) movie review for a Mike Meyers new movie called The Love Guru
267255	0.62	3.366	1.0	0	What's up Expo TV
267255	11.116	15.658	0.0	3	 Like there's been a lot of trailers for it
267255	9.49	12.056	-1.0	2	 Came out last week
267255	17.98	26.643	-0.6666666865348816	5	 It's rated PG-thirteen for crude and sexual content, language, some violence and drug references
267255	15.975	18.921	0.0	4	 (uhh) it's ninety minutes long
267255	33.256	63.629	-0.3333333432674408	7	 Like who are basically like, like, like, (stutter) they know everything about dating and love and stuff and (uhh) like he gets sent on this mission to like, I guess help out a marriage between between (stutter) Toronto Maple Leafs player and like his wife because his wife has been seeing a guy from from the Los Angeles Kings
267255	27.239	33.378	0.0	6	 (uhh) The movie's about how he was adopted by a by gurus
267255	72.187	76.54	-0.3333333432674408	9	 But like it really doesn't work cause it's supposed to be really funny
267255	63.128	72.589	0.0	8	 So (uhh) It's So it's like so it's like (stutter) how like he's like trying to help out this marriage
267278	118.951	129.888	-2.3333332538604736	20	 So a full length movie is really hard to pull off with this premise, you know? The premise itself might have been good, might have been workable, but this is definitely not a workable version of it
267278	128.888	132.882	-2.6666667461395264	21	 So I'm going to give The Love Guru a one out of five
267278	134.556	142.131	-1.6666666269302368	22	 (umm) Rent it maybe? See it at a super budget price maybe? But (uhh) it's questionable whether or not you should even do that
267278	141.629	149.693	-2.0	23	 So Love Guru one out of five for being a very crude, very juvenile adaptation of a not so great premise
267278	6.267	11.298	0.0	1	 As formality here's my movie ticket, and there we go
267278	0.43	6.848	0.0	0	Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie The Love Guru starring Mike Myers
267278	15.766	21.255	1.6666666269302368	3	 I mean (uhh) Austin Powers was pretty hilarious, almost all of them were
267278	11.116	16.766	0.3333333432674408	2	 So, what'd I think about this movie? Mike Myers is usually pretty funny
267278	23.668	26.274	-1.0	5	 Love Guru not so much
267278	21.742	23.889	2.3333332538604736	4	 (uhh) Wayne's World was funny
267278	30.043	44.173	-2.3333332538604736	7	 It's just primarily that most of the movie is really crude and, you know, for a guy that usually does humor that's a little better than this, I mean it can be slapstick and silly, but not usually quite this level of just crude stupidness
267278	26.032	30.474	0.3333333432674408	6	 I mean it's not that Love Guru doesn't have at least a few funny jokes
267278	50.177	59.728	1.3333333730697632	9	 You know I always thought that Austin Powers was pretty juvenile, but in reality it was actually a fairly good level of intellect
267278	43.173	49.94	-2.3333332538604736	8	 Makes you wonder what he's thinking when he decided to make this movie
267278	65.912	67.75	-1.0	11	" It could have been a lot stupider"""
267278	59.277	66.722	-1.3333333730697632	10	" Sort of a James Bondy joke, you know? And you really only realize this after watching this movie when you go ""Oh"
267278	71.229	79.872	0.0	13	 It's about a guy, India, wants to learn to be, you know, a guru so girls will like him
267278	66.909	71.621	-2.6666667461395264	12	 Which is exactly what this movie is, it's stupid
267278	83.013	91.057	-0.3333333432674408	15	 So, you know, he becomes this guru and sort of this idea of like ahh it's the horny, chastised love guru
267278	79.311	83.015	-0.6666666865348816	14	 You know, it's even the line that he uses in the preview
267278	105.043	113.386	-1.3333333730697632	17	 In reality I really feel this movie is like, yeah, (umm) it's about on par with some of the stupid Saturday Night Live sketches
267278	91.254	104.875	-1.6666666269302368	16	 He's kind of a dork and the stuff he says is just sort of ridiculous most of the time, and the advice he gives is horrible and sorta questions whether or not it's any good at all
267278	115.609	119.332	-2.3333332538604736	19	 Which, you know, are best tolerated for about two minutes
267278	112.685	116.269	-1.0	18	 You know, not even the good ones, but about the stupid ones
267799	76.298	82.756	-2.3333332538604736	11	 (uhh) So (uhh) and there was one character in particular that was just incredibly annoying (uhh) in the middle of it
267799	57.79	76.729	-2.0	10	 (uhh) It was it was (stutter) not funny at all, I like maybe laughed, I'd say maybe five times, one time pretty hard at something that happened, (umm) but (uhh) over the course of forty minutes laughing five times at a part that is (uhh) supposed to be funny from start to finish, (umm) that just doesn't, didn't cut it for me
267799	86.275	90.418	0.0	13	 (uhh) There is no way that any normal human being would invite him to a party
267799	82.224	86.836	-1.6666666269302368	12	 His name was (uhh) Jim Parsons and I absolutely hated him
267799	95.285	99.178	-2.3333332538604736	15	 {laugh} (umm) Yeah I really didn't like this movie at, at, at (stutter) all
267799	91.304	94.519	-1.0	14	 (umm) I'm going to hold this up here to block something out
267799	100.194	104.566	-2.6666667461395264	17	 The middle of it totally ruined everything that came before and after it
267799	98.178	100.815	0.6666666865348816	16	 The first third of it was, was (stutter) pretty good
267799	108.984	129.549	-1.6666666269302368	19	 (umm) Special features (uhh) include (uhh) deleted scenes, a making of (uhh) featurette, and (uhh) yeah plenty of making of featurettes and (uhh) director's commentaries, so (uhh) (uhh) I I I (stutter) don't recommend the special features, (uhh) I I (stutter) can't because I didn't watch them because I didn't like this movie (uhh) enough to watch them, so I don't recommend this movie
267799	104.135	108.926	0.6666666865348816	18	 And (umm) the final third was mixed, it was okay
267799	3.054	5.571	0.0	1	 This movie is called The Signal
267799	0.0	4.005	0.0	0	Hello, playing over my shoulder is this movie
267799	7.544	13.712	0.0	3	 It's because three people, three different people, wrote it and directed it (uhh) all separately
267799	5.16	8.345	-2.0	2	 I didn't like this movie and I'll tell you why
267799	31.121	37.289	-1.3333333730697632	5	 And (uhh) it just drives people insane, it (uhh) makes them want to just you know, wig out and start killing each other
267799	13.481	31.722	0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) It utilizes pretty much the same cast from beginning to end and it's about (umm) (uhh) some sort of a strange signal that is (uhh) broadcast from an (uhh) unspecified source (uhh) over television waves and (uhh) radio waves and cellular phones, and regular phone lines
267799	43.004	46.388	-0.3333333432674408	7	 It felt like something along the lines of twenty-eight days later
267799	36.798	44.004	2.0	6	 And the first third of the movie I really enjoyed, I thought it was a really solid setup (umm) for a pretty good horror movie
267799	49.579	58.112	-2.0	9	 And in the middle of the movie (umm) tried really, really hard (uhh) to be funny and failed spectacularly
267799	45.937	50.13	1.3333333730697632	8	 And it just, it felt really solid and like it was going to be a good movie
268836	112.665	114.493	-1.3333333730697632	24	 So unbelievable
268836	114.292	120.699	-1.3333333730697632	25	 Dude is so bad, it's just like embarrassing, some of the acting he does
268836	120.986	123.772	-2.0	26	 And (uhh) yeah, it just wasn't good
268836	122.772	124.361	0.0	27	 And he, M
268836	91.024	98.45	-0.6666666865348816	20	 But no, the the (stutter) three or four times you see it happening in the previews are the only times it happens in the movie
268836	97.909	107.888	-2.0	21	 So basically you could save yourself the time, go on Youtube and watch the preview of the movie, and you would get all the most intense parts of the movie in that preview
268836	107.477	110.243	-1.6666666269302368	22	 (uhh) The rest of the movie (stutter) stunk
268836	109.702	113.416	-2.3333332538604736	23	 (uhh) Mark Wahlberg, terrible, terrible actor
268836	123.361	126.366	0.0	28	 Night Shamalyan is always in his own movies
268836	125.795	128.112	-0.6666666865348816	29	 Which, sometimes it's not bad
268836	9.62	14.171	-2.0	1	 (umm) And I was hoping I would forget about it, that's why I haven't done a review on it yet
268836	0.0	9.113	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey what's up Expo TV? (umm) Stephen Boyd here (uhh) here to talk about a movie I saw about a week ago
268836	19.427	25.366	-2.3333332538604736	3	 It was a movie called The Happening, and it was bad, it was really really bad
268836	13.99	19.469	-2.6666667461395264	2	 (umm) It was a depressing experience (uhh) to say the least
268836	31.161	34.236	-0.3333333432674408	5	 Night Shamylan I think
268836	26.142	32.001	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) Here's the thing, it was written and directed by, I can never say this guy's name right,M
268836	33.545	37.01	0.3333333432674408	7	 Night Shmamalan or something like that
268836	33.475	34.545	0.0	6	 M
268836	37.187	39.284	0.0	9	 It's written and directed by him
268836	36.01	37.588	-0.3333333432674408	8	 But anyways
268836	160.786	163.652	-3.0	39	 Really disappointed, don't waste your time
268836	157.733	161.307	-0.3333333432674408	38	 I was like oh, I like your other movies, I'll see this one
268836	39.262	41.31	0.0	11	 He did The Sixth Sense
268836	38.634	40.262	0.0	10	 You all know him
268836	42.834	44.662	0.0	13	 (umm) Those movies
268836	40.31	43.136	0.0	12	 He did Signs
268836	55.056	58.97	-0.3333333432674408	15	 (umm) Everyones making a big deal because it was his first R rated movie
268836	44.221	55.278	-2.3333332538604736	14	 And I really love those movies and I, I (stutter) though, you know his other movies weren't as bad as people made them seem, you know they weren't like fantastic, but this movie is just terrible
268836	66.241	72.649	-1.0	17	 Like I was hopping there'd be more violence because if you go to a rated R movie about like
268836	58.379	66.981	-1.6666666269302368	16	 I was like Oh okay well, you know there's a reason it's probably rated R and it just kinda sucked
268836	74.312	91.725	-0.6666666865348816	19	 Basically it's like a family on the run from like this, this (stutter) natural crisis that's taking people over and like making them kill themselves in really horrific way, and in the previews you see like three or four people killing themselves and you're like oh my gosh that's really intense, this is gonna be a really intense movie
268836	72.267	75.312	0.0	18	 Oh yeah I guess I should tell you a little bit about the plot
268836	129.587	132.313	-1.3333333730697632	31	 I don't know, he's not a very good actor either
268836	127.112	129.839	-2.6666667461395264	30	 In this one it's just like stupid
268836	153.922	158.733	-2.3333332538604736	37	 It really let me down and also because I gave him a chance
268836	152.315	154.922	-2.0	36	 So one out of five stars for this movie
268836	140.133	152.996	-1.6666666269302368	35	 You could like, go watch (umm) all the videos that Expo TV rejected for two hours, or an hour and a half, and that would be a better (uhh) better way to spend your time than to see this movie
268836	137.549	140.454	-1.0	34	 There's so many better things you could do with your time
268836	134.845	138.0	-3.0	33	 It was so bad
268836	131.353	135.845	-1.6666666269302368	32	 But (umm) don't even rent this movie
26WrTHLJJIU	0.0	10.61	0.6666666865348816	0	So we’re the Ohio state university, so we definitely have a passionate feel for all our big ten colleagues out there.
26WrTHLJJIU	18.958	24.129	1.3333333730697632	2	That’s only going to be a major positive for you as you’re coming through the process.
270416	55.685	64.068	-2.0	11	 It's supposed to be a comedy but you'll go in there and you'll be waiting to laugh but you never will, and then it'll be time to go
270416	48.93	55.448	-1.6666666269302368	10	 The best thing about the movie was that it's only eighty-seven minutes long so you don't have to endure too much
270416	65.961	72.798	-1.6666666269302368	13	 I'd say (stutter) there's much more movies out there that are (uhh) so much more better than this
270416	63.527	66.961	-2.0	12	 So I wouldn't recommend this movie at all
270416	2.625	8.454	-1.0	1	 If you want to waste your time go see one called The Love Guru
270416	0.69	3.256	0.0	0	I just returned from the movies
270416	11.216	15.818	0.0	3	 Guru, okay? Has Ben Kingsley in it
270416	8.342	11.468	0.0	2	 That's G U R U
270416	19.407	23.56	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simson
270416	15.087	19.23	0.0	4	 It's got Mike Myers, he's the, the (stutter) main character
270416	23.658	41.06	-0.3333333432674408	7	 It's got a few others in there (uhh) that you will probably have heard about and usually when a movie has a lot of different people in it that you know about it's usually not gonna be very good and this one wasn't
270416	22.899	24.478	0.0	6	 Simpson
270416	41.906	49.711	-1.6666666269302368	9	 He (stutter) co-wrote this movie from what I understand and it's just, it's just absolutely horrid
270416	40.06	42.717	-2.6666667461395264	8	 Mike Myers is absolutely awful
270444	8.562	24.408	-1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm) Hellboy Two, I wasn't all that excited to go see this but you know, people are going to see it so I was like, whatever I'll go and it definitely didn't live up to even my low expectations
270444	0.55	8.335	0.0	0	Hey expotv, today I'm gonna review the movie that's currently in theaters (umm) and that movie would be Hellboy Two
270444	27.379	32.59	0.0	3	 (umm) By the way the subtitle to this movie is Hellboy Two and the Golden Army
270444	23.408	26.962	-2.3333332538604736	2	 I thought it was worse than what I thought it would be
270444	43.054	47.715	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) I don't know, something about the whole Hellboy theme I don't really like, personally
270444	32.198	41.41	-0.6666666865348816	4	 Pretty much it's more just rampaging through Hellboy beating people down and saying clever little phrases
270444	51.834	67.77	-1.0	7	 So you know if you're a, if you're (stutter) a Hellboy fan you'll probably like it actually, but if you're just a general viewer I highly doubt you'll enjoy it, just because you don't really have any connection to it and it's just not good
270444	47.314	51.896	-0.3333333432674408	6	 You know, it's another one of these blockbusters from a comic book
270444	67.169	73.537	-2.3333332538604736	8	 If you don't have a connection it probably won't be good cause it's it's (stutter) just annoying
270449	61.861	64.407	-0.3333333432674408	11	 (uhh) I'd say it was the average anime
270449	57.481	60.736	-2.0	10	 I, I (stutter) didn't see it so much
270449	4.322	6.389	0.3333333432674408	1	 It's a anime
270449	0.74	4.374	-0.3333333432674408	0	This is Blood: The Last Vampire
270449	8.622	12.495	0.6666666865348816	3	 A lot of people highly recommend this
270449	6.227	9.622	1.0	2	 It's considered like a masterpiece
270449	16.893	22.063	-0.6666666865348816	5	 They even made a series after it, based off of the movie
270449	12.094	17.065	-1.6666666269302368	4	 I watched it, I didn't think it was that great
270449	30.063	42.657	-0.6666666865348816	7	 It didn't actually start taking root til the very end of the like the last thirty minutes of the movie and by that time it was already over
270449	22.72	30.345	-1.0	6	 The story, by the time it got started, it was already over
270449	53.34	58.381	-0.6666666865348816	9	 But a lot of people praised it for its graphics at the time
270449	42.545	53.402	-1.0	8	 The animation, the graphics of it, it was it looked really good in some parts, and it some parts it looked horrible
270628	150.928	159.491	-2.0	24	 It was kind of depressing in parts and it just didn't rebound to give the highs to the positive notes of the movie like it should have
270628	158.85	166.485	-1.6666666269302368	25	 So even though it, the music dragged you down with a sad part of the movie, it did not bring you back up when it turned around and got happy
270628	165.485	172.452	0.6666666865348816	26	 And I don't want to ruin anything, give away any plot spoilers or anything like that, (uhh) but things, you know, get better
270628	171.452	177.321	0.0	27	 When, when (stutter) he has an awakening, you can kind of expect that things are going to look up from there
270628	134.975	137.651	-1.3333333730697632	20	 So I was let down, quite honestly
270628	137.289	146.092	0.3333333432674408	21	 (umm) I had heard little about the film before I saw it, but what I had heard was positive and, and, (stutter) your know, uplifting and thinking that it was going to be a good movie
270628	146.139	149.753	-0.6666666865348816	22	 (umm) But, like I said, everything put together here wasn't
270628	149.053	151.679	-2.3333332538604736	23	 The soundtrack was downer
270628	177.219	189.643	-0.3333333432674408	28	 One thing to make the movie better, I think, I think (stutter) when it goes into the actual writing and directing, I don't think the writer or director brought out what they could have in these actors and actresses
270628	188.902	198.343	0.3333333432674408	29	 Now, the writer just writes it and kind of leaves it at that, but a lot of them tweak it (uhh) based on what the (umm) actors' and actresses' input is
270628	1.538	9.532	0.0	1	 Aubs eighty four here today to talk to you about the movie the Ripple Effect, which is currently in theaters
270628	0.0	0.672	0.0	0	Hey, ExpoTV
270628	15.097	22.024	0.0	3	 (uhh) Forest Whitaker and Minnie Driver are the two that I recognized and that I have seen in other films
270628	9.28	15.588	-1.0	2	 (umm) This movie is kind of low budget and doesn't feature a lot of well-known actors or actresses
270628	34.144	36.58	-1.0	5	 Everything is kind of going downhill
270628	22.829	35.144	0.0	4	 (umm) The basic storyline of this movie is that there is a Hollywood (uhh) director and his life has kind of fallen apart, his marriage, his finances, his relationships
270628	44.181	54.18	-0.3333333432674408	7	 So just like if you throw a rock in a, in a (stutter) pool of water, (umm) the ripples kind of go out and they alter and affect all the water around them
270628	36.069	45.181	0.0	6	 And the idea is that these changes kind of ripple out and affect all aspects of his life and lead to new things
270628	63.008	67.849	1.0	9	 (umm) Fortunately, though, this guy does not let that ruin him or bring him down
270628	53.769	63.18	-0.6666666865348816	8	 In the same same (stutter) (uhh) stance, when his personal life kind of falls apart, it ripples out and affects this guy's professional life as well
270628	82.683	88.363	-1.0	11	 Now, I don't know if this movie is (uhh) very well done, quite honestly
270628	66.849	82.307	0.6666666865348816	10	 It actually leads to a sort of awakening or revival, and he sets out to change a few things and to make his life better and to try to take, take (stutter) things into his own hands and do what he can to right all the situations
270628	93.798	101.832	-1.0	13	 And the main actor in this one also, even though I've never seen him before, I have to believe that he's had better performances like this
270628	88.361	94.419	-2.0	12	 (umm) It kind of seems like Minnie Driver and Forest Whitaker have had much better performances
270628	103.277	116.778	-1.0	15	 I just don't picture this guy as as (stutter), I don't (stutter) picture the actor actually being this guy, going through this really hard time and, and (stutter) struggling through his life, as he deals with his marriage and everything else
270628	101.211	104.277	-1.6666666269302368	14	 He doesn't seem to embody the character very well
270628	119.011	121.458	-2.0	17	 (umm) A poor job in that respect
270628	115.778	119.362	-1.0	16	 He doesn't sell it very well, in other words
270628	126.075	135.705	-1.6666666269302368	19	 (umm) As I mentioned, the supporting actors and actresses kind of don't live up to the billing, they don't live up to (umm) what they could have done and what they have done in some of their other roles
270628	120.757	126.476	0.0	18	 And I think that, like the movie says, ripples out and affects the rest of the cast as well
270628	208.887	211.234	-0.6666666865348816	31	 But I just don't see that being done
270628	197.343	209.557	0.0	30	 So, for instance, if they think this scene might work a little bit better this way, or if the director suggest that (umm) this scene might be better dialogued this way, you know, the writer writes that in and makes changes
270628	223.813	225.79	-2.3333332538604736	35	 (uhh) Save your money
270628	220.65	224.084	-2.3333332538604736	34	 Not a whole lot of redeeming quality about this movie
270628	218.545	221.371	-2.6666667461395264	33	 I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars
270628	210.234	219.205	-2.6666667461395264	32	 Maybe he was just given bad advice and made changes for the worse, or maybe, like I think, the actors, actresses, and director just weren't in this one wholeheartedly
270665	154.231	158.883	-1.6666666269302368	24	 The soundtrack is nonexistent, for the most part
270665	158.741	165.857	-2.3333332538604736	25	 Not that it could have added much to a movie like this, but still, at least maybe some good music would have redeemed it in a small way
270665	165.286	167.064	0.0	26	 But not even that
270665	166.064	168.381	-2.0	27	 So it's all downhill
270665	142.428	146.002	0.0	20	 Gets up the next morning and it goes, anyway, you get the idea
270665	145.271	147.798	-1.0	21	 It keeps going round and round and round
270665	146.798	149.534	-1.0	22	 Same thing over and over and over again
270665	148.863	154.802	-2.6666667461395264	23	 Not worth seeing, not worth renting, not worth wasting your life over, quite frankly
270665	168.119	170.985	-2.3333332538604736	28	 (umm) Nobody can really act in this one
270665	169.985	180.763	-2.6666667461395264	29	 It all keeps, seems very staged, very set up, nobody is acting natural, nobody is getting into their roles, and nobody is meshing with one another
270665	8.153	26.813	-2.6666667461395264	1	 (umm) This is a very low-quality film, very low budget, nobody (uhh) of any kind of (umm) ability actually in acting is in this film (umm) no well-known actors, no well-known actresses, nobody directing or even writing it that you probably would have ever heard of
270665	0.56	8.514	0.0	0	ExpoTV, this is Aubs eighty four and I'm going to talk to you today about the movie The Doorman, which is currently in theaters
270665	33.326	37.069	0.3333333432674408	3	 And he's very popular, very well known
270665	26.561	33.937	0.0	2	 It follows the story of a doorman in New York City, or basically a bouncer at one of the clubs
270665	43.602	47.605	0.3333333432674408	5	 And it's all about him and his life and he's so cool
270665	36.329	44.024	-1.0	4	 (uhh) He kind of goes on a big power trip about how he can get people into this club and how he knows all these people and blah, blah, blah
270665	55.635	62.422	0.0	7	 (uhh) The people he knew and were so friendly with, I mean, they don't talk to him anymore since the, he can't get them into any clubs
270665	47.404	56.106	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (uhh) But eventually, he loses his job and he comes crashing down to earth (uhh) when he loses his job because he realizes he pretty much has nothing to go on
270665	65.991	68.777	-0.3333333432674408	9	 And they weren't really friends at all
270665	61.751	66.642	-0.3333333432674408	8	 They were basically using him for (uhh) his position at the door
270665	77.535	104.576	0.0	11	 Now, that that (stutter) may sound like it has some potential and it may be going somewhere and it could be, you know, some big story about self-revelation or interesting of the fact that he knows all these people and it could be synopses of people's lives that come to the club and the information he can get from them, and, you know, just kind of cool, it could be kind of like a back, (uhh) behind-the-scenes type of cool thing about these popular people
270665	67.837	77.637	0.0	10	 And he kind of tries to come to terms with this, has to get a grip on things and realize what's actually going on in his life and what he has going for him
270665	106.15	108.667	-2.0	13	 It's actually quite terrible
270665	104.554	107.15	-1.0	12	 (umm) However, it's nothing like that
270665	119.989	124.082	-2.6666667461395264	15	 The writing (umm) was pathetic, (uhh) quite frankly
270665	107.976	120.48	-1.6666666269302368	14	 It is basically a big ego trip by this doorman guy (umm) and how he wallows in self-pity and self-realization when it turns out that he actually has nothing
270665	124.987	127.464	-0.3333333432674408	17	 It's basically a big circle
270665	123.082	125.638	-2.3333332538604736	16	 The story goes nowhere
270665	199.458	201.915	-2.6666667461395264	33	 Do not waste your time on this one
270665	194.749	200.119	-3.0	32	 (uhh) One out of five stars is what I have to give it because I can't give a zero out of five stars
270665	189.052	195.33	-2.6666667461395264	31	 I would say that this movie should have gone straight to DVD or straight to the garbage, quite frankly
270665	180.132	189.623	-1.3333333730697632	30	 It's almost as if they're all competing with each other to get a space and to try to get themselves known so they can go to Hollywood and make a real good film
270665	138.976	142.729	0.0	19	 Gets up the next morning and it goes around in a circle again
270665	126.803	139.397	0.0	18	 He wakes up one day, feels sorry for himself, tries to get over it, can't, goes out, gets shunned by these people he's tied to, comes back, and crashes, gets drunk and is worthless
270956	60.284	68.179	-2.0	11	 It had so much potential and it could have been a whole lot better but it was just pretty poorly done
270956	57.072	60.756	-1.0	10	 (umm) It just (uhh) I didn't enjoy it
270956	77.605	92.304	-0.3333333432674408	13	 (umm) Young people in their twenties, thirties, or young children like teenagers, or even little (uhh) ten-year-olds they may enjoy this cause it's (uhh) I mean they may find the jokes funny but I didn't
270956	67.767	77.388	-1.3333333730697632	12	 And so I wouldn't recommend to see it, but (umm) I guess the target audience would be people in my age group
270956	95.115	98.3	-0.6666666865348816	15	 And (uhh) so, yeah
270956	91.304	95.606	-2.3333332538604736	14	 It was just (uhh) not adult humor I guess
270956	98.897	100.465	-0.6666666865348816	17	 That's it
270956	97.929	99.677	-1.6666666269302368	16	 Didn't like it
270956	1.049	3.975	0.0	1	 Today I'm reviewing Hellboy Two
270956	0.63	2.049	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
270956	5.419	11.996	-2.6666667461395264	3	 (uhh) I went to go see this movie (umm) and it was a big disappointment
270956	2.975	6.22	0.0	2	 It's currently playing in theaters right now
270956	20.664	25.665	-1.3333333730697632	5	 But (uhh) when I saw it I was just unimpressed
270956	11.126	21.664	0.6666666865348816	4	 From the trailers it looked (uhh) really action packed and exciting and (umm) kind of like a fairy tale with a darker side
270956	44.121	48.424	-1.6666666269302368	7	 And I just expected so much more from it
270956	25.533	45.071	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (umm) The little side jokes weren't funny at all, and the acting was just kind of so bland and just the overall presentation and performance of everything about this movie it just wasn't satisfactory for me
270956	51.315	56.316	-2.0	9	 (umm) If I had to give it a rating I'd say it's a two out of five for me
270956	47.483	51.507	-2.0	8	 So I didn't enjoy it a whole lot at all
271366	184.602	189.363	-0.6666666865348816	42	 Or if you're going to, go see matinee or something cheaper, seriously
271366	188.693	191.478	-1.3333333730697632	43	 I just, I think you're gonna get bored with it
271366	105.671	112.568	1.0	24	 It was in a way it was entertaining, in a way
271366	111.568	114.553	-2.6666667461395264	25	 But really it's not worth your money
271366	113.553	123.553	-1.6666666269302368	26	 I I (stutter) think if you took your kids to go see it I think I think teenage audiences or them might enjoy it but really, it's that great a movie
271366	122.553	128.621	-2.6666667461395264	27	 I think it's (stutter) I think it's gonna fail (umm) on all levels
271366	75.46	85.13	-2.6666667461395264	20	 I mean the public is so used to special effects and computer effects now that we expect a lot more and we are being insulted by this movie
271366	84.549	100.405	-1.6666666269302368	21	 Everything about it, the special effects you can tell are fake and they're just trying to put so much action on you and and (stutter) CGI and special effects that like the movie and the plot just are completely lost and they're just trying to throw that to make up for it
271366	99.405	103.858	-2.0	22	 So really and it doesn't make up for it at all
271366	102.888	106.342	-2.0	23	 So I do not recommend seeing this movie
271366	199.558	201.226	-1.0	46	 It's not good
271366	190.478	197.854	-1.6666666269302368	44	 It's just too much CGI, too much action and it's it's (stutter) over the top, it really is
271366	196.914	200.268	-2.0	45	 So don't go see it in my opinion
271366	127.621	130.258	-2.0	28	 Really I don't think it's good at all
271366	130.395	133.121	1.0	29	 Really, I mean just, you gotta go see it
271366	181.409	183.367	-2.0	40	 Do not go see it really
271366	182.367	184.814	-2.6666667461395264	41	 Do not waste your money on it
271366	2.695	5.371	-1.6666666269302368	1	 I'm gonna just come out right and say it
271366	0.311	3.695	-0.3333333432674408	0	The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
271366	6.327	10.19	-3.0	3	 It fails on every level possible
271366	4.371	6.539	-2.0	2	 Do not go see this movie
271366	12.074	15.099	-1.6666666269302368	5	 They probably even shouldn't have made the second one to be honest
271366	9.59	12.366	-2.0	4	 They shouldn't have not even made the movie
271366	19.477	24.867	-2.0	7	 (umm) The casting, Rachel Weisz, is not a return a big problem there
271366	14.868	19.06	-1.6666666269302368	6	 And (uhh) there's, I can't really say one good thing about this movie
271366	24.675	27.411	0.0	9	 It really has an effect on the movie
271366	24.007	25.675	0.0	8	 Big problem
271366	178.765	182.0	-2.0	39	 Other than that though I do not recommend this movie at all
271366	176.59	179.765	1.0	38	 So that's that's (stutter) one good thing I'd say about it
271366	32.498	35.623	-2.0	11	 Brendan Fraser just fails entirely
271366	26.411	32.959	-1.0	10	 You don't love the characters as much cause the original actress that played Brendan Fraser's wife is not back
271366	43.034	44.922	-2.0	13	 Just, it's terrible
271366	34.623	43.844	-1.6666666269302368	12	 He's not funny anymore, he's getting older, and the whole hero guy who tries to be funny with the one-liners, just just (stutter) stop
271366	53.171	59.598	-1.0	15	 But you don't care, you really don't care about the tomb of the Dragon Emperor, this Dragon Emperor guy, you don't care
271366	44.341	53.133	0.0	14	 The plot it has nothing to do with the first or second Mummy anymore, which is you know, it's a good idea you know? Maybe get away from that
271366	66.211	69.615	-2.6666667461395264	17	 You can it's it's (stutter) insulting
271366	59.766	67.211	-1.6666666269302368	16	 (umm) The special effects are way too over the top and not only are they over the top, but they are fake
271366	71.449	76.46	-1.3333333730697632	19	 (umm) And I'm not trying to be like, mean about it like you need to do better but they do need to do better
271366	68.955	71.491	-2.6666667461395264	18	 It is insulting the way they are
271366	134.027	135.985	-1.3333333730697632	31	 It's just old
271366	132.121	134.518	0.6666666865348816	30	 You gotta know what I'm talking about
271366	171.482	177.59	0.6666666865348816	37	 Like it's just so unbelievable that you just gotta sit back and kind of enjoy the ride while you go along with it
271366	164.158	172.482	0.0	36	 I mean obviously it's not gonna be real, you know, a mummy coming to life but like it's just so over the top that it's like somewhat entertaining you know what I mean
271366	152.166	165.158	-0.6666666865348816	35	 (umm) I guess the good thing about the movie was it was it was (stutter) so it was it was (stutter) so like bad that it was entertaining cause like, you kinda lose yourself in it in the fact that it's not real
271366	146.738	151.689	-1.0	34	 It it (stutter) was old five years ago, seriously so just stop it
271366	143.366	147.159	-2.6666667461395264	33	 It's really boring, it's old, it's cheesy
271366	135.344	144.366	-1.3333333730697632	32	 The Mummy franchise is dead, or they need to reboot it or something because Brendan Fraser's one-liners in all this stuff, it's just the public's not gonna take it anymore
271594	112.745	114.773	-0.6666666865348816	24	 It's still the same thing
271594	114.062	116.978	-2.6666667461395264	25	 No one does a very good job on their acting
271594	115.978	119.602	-1.6666666269302368	26	 Not a single actor whatsoever
271594	119.61	122.675	-2.0	27	 So, dialogue is bad
271594	93.269	100.765	-1.0	20	 It's not that great, cause really even in the end, it's just a vague rehashing of the previous ones
271594	100.054	103.658	-1.6666666269302368	21	 So the story itself is not done very well
271594	102.658	110.832	-1.3333333730697632	22	 It just, they didn't add anything new to it for me at a previous incarnations, besides the old, let's just set it in a different location
271594	109.832	113.276	-0.3333333432674408	23	 And it's not in Egypt anymore now, it's in China
271594	122.124	125.129	-0.6666666865348816	28	 I haven't mentioned that yet, but I am right now
271594	124.129	128.282	-2.0	29	 Dialogue's bad, acting's bad, the story's bad
271594	156.755	158.753	-2.3333332538604736	40	 One out of five, boohoo
271594	157.753	162.205	-0.6666666865348816	41	 I'm going away now
271594	7.285	10.42	0.0	1	 As formality, here is my movie ticket
271594	0.849	7.716	0.6666666865348816	0	Hello everybody, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Curse of the Dragon Emperor
271594	15.815	19.1	0.0	3	 mommy vision whoo
271594	12.273	16.476	0.0	2	 Here it is again, and this time in slo-mo
271594	23.219	25.316	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) That's not what it should be called
271594	18.769	22.902	0.0	4	 Alright so the movie is called Curse of the Dragon Emperor
271594	28.257	31.412	0.6666666865348816	7	 The first one was alright, I will admit that
271594	24.316	28.329	-2.0	6	 It should be called, why do you keep making this series
271594	33.076	36.83	-1.6666666269302368	9	 And from that point on they've all been sort of been downhill
271594	30.412	33.088	2.0	8	 It was actually a fairly good movie
271594	151.008	157.566	-2.3333332538604736	39	 So this has been Mike, saying hey, it's not good, don't see it
271594	144.932	151.549	-1.6666666269302368	38	 At least that might convince people, hey we should stop making these movies and maybe make something new for once
271594	39.442	44.433	-2.6666667461395264	11	 This is probably gonna go down as one of the dumbest movies ever made
271594	35.83	39.673	-2.0	10	 With this one probably being the worst one
271594	50.916	57.643	0.0	13	 Chinese Emperor was imprisoned in a sort of suspended animation cryogenic state
271594	44.45	51.227	0.0	12	 So basic premise, (umm) in the distant past a few thousand years ago
271594	59.666	71.421	-0.3333333432674408	15	 And, so him and his army are disguised as the Terracotta Army and the guy from the first previous movies are (umm) accidentally wakes him up and now that guy's gonna try to take over the world
271594	57.261	59.429	0.0	14	 Except for without freezing
271594	77.415	81.668	-2.0	17	 (uhh) Number two, that's not that clever of a plot
271594	71.529	76.5	-0.6666666865348816	16	 Yeah, so number one, there's no mummy, technically
271594	91.743	94.269	0.0	19	 But that's really all that is
271594	82.025	92.104	-0.6666666865348816	18	 You know, it's it's (stutter) sort of clever, you're like, oh well, I can take like vaguely historical things and sort of thread it together to be something (umm) junky
271594	132.171	134.498	-2.0	31	 It's not worth seeing
271594	128.439	132.642	-2.6666667461395264	30	 And (umm) so yeah, this series needs to stop
271594	143.934	145.932	-1.6666666269302368	37	 Don't go see it
271594	142.867	144.715	-3.0	36	 Let it die
271594	141.939	143.737	-2.6666667461395264	35	 It's stupid
271594	136.681	141.532	-3.0	34	 It's not even worth seeing at your friends house, for free
271594	134.925	137.052	-1.3333333730697632	33	 It's not worth renting
271594	133.797	135.925	-2.0	32	 I, this isn't worth seeing
271598	109.173	117.816	-1.0	24	 And so then you're just end with, you know, it's a political movie that's supposed to be like, oh, sort of satirical a little, but it's not very satirical
271598	117.634	128.492	-0.6666666865348816	25	 So what you end up with is they took a movie that, they took two movies, really, one that's sort of the Disney culture movie of, hey, look, we're making a family-friendly movie
271598	127.492	134.039	-2.6666667461395264	26	 But that fails because it's boring and can't hold anyone's attention, a child or an adult
271598	133.368	137.96	-0.3333333432674408	27	 And then they sort of had a sort of, hey, let's make a satirical political movie
271598	91.823	94.888	-2.0	20	 It's, there's nothing really exciting
271598	93.888	100.815	-1.3333333730697632	21	 Kevin Costner put in an all-right performance, but that's not enough to save the fact that this movie just isn't very good
271598	100.912	104.985	-1.3333333730697632	22	 You know? The premise is sort of laughable
271598	104.773	109.156	-2.3333332538604736	23	 The implementation is meh, thumbs down
271598	137.17	141.372	-2.0	28	 And that sort of fails because it's not well done
271598	140.881	145.533	-1.6666666269302368	29	 They didn't satirize (stutter) anything to a sufficient degree
271598	1.518	5.78	0.0	1	 My name is Mike and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Swing Vote
271598	0.889	2.328	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey, hey
271598	10.088	11.887	0.0	3	 And there we go
271598	5.229	8.375	0.0	2	 As formality, here is my movie ticket
271598	22.55	26.883	-0.6666666865348816	5	 He, you know, doesn't really give a care about anything
271598	12.134	22.353	-0.6666666865348816	4	 So the basic premise of this movie is as follows: Kevin Costner plays a character who is just sort of the (uhh) lame sort of loser
271598	31.25	37.618	-0.3333333432674408	7	 His daughter tries to get him to vote, so he goes and votes, and it causes a screw-up that la-de-dah-de-dah
271598	26.95	31.492	-0.3333333432674408	6	 And (uhh) so his life is just sort of passing him by
271598	40.04	45.42	0.0	9	 Causing it so that his vote is the one that decides the presidential election
271598	38.703	40.472	0.0	8	 Big surprise
271598	46.356	51.666	-0.6666666865348816	11	 Well, that's a pretty unlikely-sounding premise, but let's run with it for a second
271598	45.568	47.027	0.0	10	 Okay
271598	60.244	62.831	0.0	13	 Everyone is trying to get his opinion
271598	51.165	61.005	-2.0	12	 So then the rest of the movie falls upon the idea of, hey, look at him becoming blobbity-blobbity, look at him deciding the election, all the things that sort of happen
271598	64.545	66.832	0.0	15	 He starts to care a little
271598	61.831	65.545	-0.3333333432674408	14	 He can't really decide, for a while, doesn't care
271598	76.847	83.254	-2.0	17	 If anything, all it does is bore people of the American political system even more
271598	66.929	77.178	-0.3333333432674408	16	 And (uhh), well, it's supposed to sort of have the message that everyone's vote matters and voting is important and look at the American political system
271598	87.762	91.645	-3.0	19	 If there was something duller than dirt, that would be it
271598	82.634	88.762	-3.0	18	 This movie is dull, dull as dirt, duller than dirt
271598	149.352	153.804	-2.3333332538604736	31	 So, Swing Vote, Kevin Costner, one out of five
271598	145.032	150.122	-1.0	30	 You know, it just sort of felt, so then you try to put it together and neither one succeeds
271598	163.799	165.418	-0.3333333432674408	34	 Goodbye
271598	159.738	164.37	-2.3333332538604736	33	 So, Mike here, saying one out of five
271598	153.423	160.339	-0.3333333432674408	32	 You know, the only reason I liked this movie in any way, shape, or form is because I like reviewing bad movies
272375	44.54	52.873	-0.3333333432674408	11	 (umm) Pineapple Express (uhh) the movie got its name because that's supposedly the name of a new new (stutter) strain of marijuana
272375	39.073	43.944	-0.6666666865348816	10	 I just didn't really think this was the best movie to go see
272375	57.301	59.898	-1.3333333730697632	13	 It's definitely not for kids
272375	52.482	57.543	-0.3333333432674408	12	 And (uhh) (uhh) and they talk about that during the movie
272375	61.392	66.832	-1.6666666269302368	15	 (umm) If you're not into what I would call a drug movie, you probably wouldn't like it
272375	58.898	61.015	0.3333333432674408	14	 It's just for adults
272375	67.957	70.324	0.0	17	 It passed the time
272375	66.78	68.807	0.0	16	 It was okay
272375	74.093	78.156	-0.6666666865348816	19	 They would probably find another movie that they would like better
272375	69.863	75.093	-1.3333333730697632	18	 It's not one that I would recommend to people to go see
272375	4.142	9.033	-1.0	1	 It wasn't my choice of movie to see, but I was outvoted on that one
272375	0.839	4.743	0.0	0	I went to the movies to see Pineapple Express
272375	11.705	17.753	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) I I'm (stutter) really not into movies about stoners and drugs and stuff like that
272375	9.071	11.039	0.6666666865348816	2	 It was okay
272375	19.737	27.032	0.0	5	 (umm) It stars Seth Rogen, who has been in just about every (uhh) movie lately, it seems like
272375	16.753	19.679	0.3333333432674408	4	 And that's what the Pineapple Express movie is
272375	29.125	34.385	0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) He was in the movie, the voice of a, one of the characters in Kung Fu Panda
272375	26.032	28.519	0.3333333432674408	6	 He was in the movie Stepbrothers
272375	36.548	40.073	0.0	9	 And he's really making a name for himself lately
272375	33.385	36.84	0.0	8	 He was in Knocked Up and Superbad
273171	40.619	48.912	0.0	11	 This movie involves a man (uhh) (stutter) or a hero, Jason, who is accused of killing his wife and he has to go to prison
273171	35.89	41.14	-0.6666666865348816	10	 It's got some similarities but it's not really what I would call a remake of that movie
273171	50.098	56.725	-0.3333333432674408	13	 And (uhh) once there he gets involved in sort of a underground race to the death (uhh) with the prisoners
273171	48.152	50.569	0.0	12	 He's wrongly accused I should say
273171	59.416	67.231	0.3333333432674408	15	 There's a lot of explosions and a lot of violence, and (uhh) the action is pretty good but all in all I kind of miss the plot
273171	55.785	60.376	-0.6666666865348816	14	 And the plot beyond that is basically there is no plot beyond that
273171	66.231	76.41	-1.3333333730697632	16	 I I (stutter) like some of the older B movies but but (stutter) when they try to update it and kind of make it into an A movie but keep the B movie plot it just didn't work
273171	1.109	4.883	0.3333333432674408	1	 I want to talk to you about Death Race starring Jason Statham
273171	0.78	2.109	0.0	0	Hello
273171	9.35	16.007	0.0	3	 It is produced by Roger Corman who is very famous for directing a lot of movies, especially during the sixties and seventies
273171	5.02	10.19	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (uhh) This movie is sort of a B movie by design
273171	22.72	25.546	0.0	5	 And that was basically his career
273171	15.406	23.48	-1.3333333730697632	4	 It's basic plot story, you know, you take (uhh) some cars and some women and a hero and throw it all together, throw in some violence, and you have a movie
273171	26.96	31.183	0.3333333432674408	7	 He actually produced one called (uhh) Death Race Two-thousand
273171	24.546	27.96	0.6666666865348816	6	 He produced (stutter) a lot of car movies back in the day
273171	34.603	36.531	-0.3333333432674408	9	 It's not really
273171	30.901	35.603	-0.3333333432674408	8	 (uhh) Some people thought that this was a sequel to that movie, or a remake of that movie
273237	144.812	147.568	-1.6666666269302368	24	 Really, it's an exaggeration of everything
273237	146.568	150.771	-2.0	25	 So please, don't go to see this movie, it's not funny
273237	150.799	153.255	-1.6666666269302368	26	 Seriously, that's all I got to say
273237	118.352	123.004	-2.3333332538604736	20	 Please, please, I am begging you
273237	122.094	124.102	-2.3333332538604736	21	 Do not see this movie
273237	123.541	130.866	-2.3333332538604736	22	 So if you think it's going to be anything what college is like it is no
273237	129.936	145.812	-2.6666667461395264	23	 Just because, you know, there, you know, there's there's (stutter) drinking in college does not mean anything that's something happens in all of them, this is completely so cliche and such one of those college movies that just, you know, exaggerates everything a hundred-million times
273237	1.737	5.671	-2.6666667461395264	1	 Starring, who cares? Written by, it doesn't matter
273237	0.64	2.189	0.0	0	College
273237	8.502	22.951	-2.0	3	 It is like this movie reminds me is is stutter almost exactly like the American Pie Band Camp, the American Pie Naked Mile except ten times worse and the fact it's in theaters and not straight to DVD or straight to the trash
273237	4.671	9.153	-2.6666667461395264	2	 It doesn't even matter anymore because this movie is absolutely terrible
273237	27.269	33.398	-0.6666666865348816	5	 In the trailer they compare this movie to like, you know, Animal House and American Pie how they were for teen comedies
273237	22.361	27.601	-2.3333332538604736	4	 Really, if you pay money to go see this movie I don't even know anymore
273237	42.195	50.728	-1.6666666269302368	7	 They're going to have, you know, language, nudity, and drinking, drugs and all that stuff cause it's, you know, college, whatever
273237	32.577	43.195	-2.3333332538604736	6	 This movie has absolutely no comedy compared to that, it obviously they're trying to go for young audiences, young adults because they're going to have sexuality in it, of course they do
273237	52.991	56.036	-2.6666667461395264	9	 The story line you don't care about anything
273237	50.177	53.991	-2.6666667461395264	8	 This movie is not funny folks, start to end
273237	57.83	59.957	0.0	11	 I can't even describe
273237	55.385	58.83	-3.0	10	 I absolutely hate this movie
273237	68.645	74.854	-2.0	13	 It is, like, what I can compare it to is a straight to DVD American Pie Presents, that's what it's trying to be
273237	59.815	69.645	-3.0	12	 Not only should of it went straight to DVD, if that, it shouldn't have been made, it shouldn't even have been thought of, okay? Really, it is that bad
273237	81.626	104.855	-0.6666666865348816	15	 The story line is about these freshmen who, or is about to be freshmen, seniors in high school and they're going to freshman orientation, okay? And they meet up (stutter) you know frat boys and all this and they become friends with them and they meet up with sorority girls and all this and then sexuality flies and then oh they get, you know, in trouble with the frat boys cause, you know, conflicts arise with the girls
273237	74.722	82.277	-2.3333332538604736	14	 And it is not funny or anything like the American Pie series or Animal House or, you know, Revenge of the Nerds like it do in the trailer
273237	106.23	110.961	-2.6666667461395264	17	 And not only is the story line terrible, the comedy is not funny, get this through your heads
273237	104.175	107.23	-3.0	16	 It is absolutely terrible
273237	115.21	119.153	-2.3333332538604736	19	 Please go see another movie or do not see this movie at all
273237	109.961	115.92	-2.3333332538604736	18	 It is not funny, okay? This movie is aimed at young adults who really have nothing better to do with their money
273314	2.107	23.131	0.3333333432674408	1	 It is a movie made off of Steve Martin's novella that he (stutter) wrote and it is about a girl that is torn between two lovers and she can't really decide between which one, the rich old man or the young man
273314	0.301	3.037	0.0	0	I'm reviewing Shopgirl the DVD
273314	27.08	30.494	-1.6666666269302368	3	 And I would not recommend this movie
273314	23.797	26.972	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) Neither of them are really going anywhere
273314	33.016	57.084	-1.6666666269302368	5	 Not really that much in the language department but it was just a very blah movie and it was supposed to be a romantic comedy but I didn't see that it was funny in any way and it was not a movie that I would recommend for anybody to go see
273314	29.494	33.917	-0.3333333432674408	4	 It is a rated R movie and it has lots of sex
273314	64.375	77.757	-0.3333333432674408	7	 It is maybe more of the Steve Martin that is in (umm) that movie I can't think of what it's called, not Grand Canyon but anyway
273314	56.134	65.006	-1.6666666269302368	6	 So if you like Steve Martin even, it's not the Steve Martin that you would think you're getting
273314	77.755	83.584	-0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) About people in LA but I've lost what I'm gonna say
273531	115.2	118.734	-2.6666667461395264	20	 So I'm gonna say one out five stars for The Mirrors
273531	118.542	122.665	-1.6666666269302368	21	 (umm) Don't waste your time with this horror flick (umm) much better ones out there
273531	1.408	8.185	-0.3333333432674408	1	 Today I'm here to talk about the movie in theaters, Mirrors (uhh) featuring Kiefer Sutherland
273531	0.0	2.209	0.0	0	Hey Expo TV
273531	14.668	27.82	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) And what I expected was a poor cliche (umm) horror film with bad acting, bad plot (umm) trying to, you know just trying to scare you and failing miserably
273531	8.023	14.521	-0.6666666865348816	2	 After seeing this one (umm) recently here, I pretty much got what I expected from it
273531	29.834	39.933	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) The premise for this movie is Kiefer Sutherland's character (umm) takes up a job as a night watchmen in a burnt out department store
273531	27.579	30.045	-0.3333333432674408	4	 That's exactly what this movie was
273531	44.52	50.888	-0.3333333432674408	7	 And (uhh) in the mirrors, naturally he sees horrific images
273531	39.781	44.343	0.0	6	 And there's mirrors in this department store
273531	52.422	56.954	-0.3333333432674408	9	 He see's himself (uhh) like being tortured and stuff like that
273531	51.145	53.422	-0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) You know, demonic images
273531	72.606	76.729	0.0	11	 Actually he needs to enlist some help from his friend Amy
273531	57.321	73.058	-2.0	10	 (umm) And I don't wanna ruin the pathetic plot of this movie (umm) but obviously he has to confront what's behind these visions in the mirrors and discover why it's happening, how it's happening, how to stop it, why it's happening to him
273531	81.706	87.674	-2.0	13	 It wasn't really scary, very very predictable (umm) and poor acting
273531	77.465	82.297	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (umm) And it's just kind of your classic (umm) bad horror film
273531	90.885	92.962	-1.6666666269302368	15	 He's not convincing
273531	86.674	91.885	-2.0	14	 Kiefer Sutherland (umm) does a very bad job in this film with his acting
273531	96.562	98.929	-2.0	17	 It seems very forced
273531	92.751	97.562	-1.0	16	 The fear he's supposed to be conveying to the audience doesn't seem real
273531	110.839	116.2	-1.6666666269302368	19	 (umm) Combine that with bad language also in the film and this movie just goes downhill
273531	98.817	110.582	-1.6666666269302368	18	 (umm) It seems like he's expecting what he's seeing (umm) which obviously as the actor he is, but as the character he supposed to be, he's not supposed to expect it so it doesn't really fit
274219	82.863	90.747	-1.0	11	 Unless you're a big fan of (uhh) the other (stutter) Star Wars related (stutter) early movies
274219	80.558	83.454	-1.3333333730697632	10	 It's not worth watching in theaters really
274219	5.06	11.697	0.0	1	 And this is a new movie (uhh) produced by George Lucas and it's part of the Star Wars series
274219	0.0	5.731	0.0	0	Hey all, it's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review The Clone Wars
274219	24.067	27.411	0.3333333432674408	3	 It branches off in a way
274219	11.615	24.827	0.0	2	 (uhh) It's, it's (stutter) CGI animated and (umm) this movie's (uhh) basically a different take on the the (stutter) Star Wars (uhh) story
274219	31.19	43.585	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) It's not too surprising though because the last three (uhh) the three new movies in the Star Wars episodes, episodes one through three were pretty (umm) awful overall
274219	26.83	30.943	-2.0	4	 And (uhh) I thought this movie was actually pretty disappointing
274219	50.227	58.79	-2.0	7	 The dialogue is just horrible and it didn't seem like this is a movie that you would expect to see in theaters
274219	42.914	51.227	-1.0	6	 And this (uhh) sticks to that (uhh) same beat as (uhh) the story is, is (stutter) pretty weak
274219	69.773	81.558	-2.0	9	 (uhh) I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you're a huge Star Wars fan, and even at that I would (uhh) I would only suggest watching it on TV or DVD or something like that
274219	57.79	69.875	-1.0	8	 It seemed more like a movie you'd, you'd find on like TV, Cartoon Network or something like that, like a (uhh) ninety minute feature length (uhh) straight to TV movie
275248	0.78	91.585	-2.0	0	Hi this Matt movie review for Momma Mia this movie is pretty much a movie all about Abba, their songs and starring Meryl Streep and and (stutter) I don't know, I don't know why I thought this movie would be interesting, I didn't realize I didn't see the preview to the movie I heard that it had the songs in there I thought well this will be interesting and I don't like musicals so this was hard for me to watch and one big problem with it is the actors are singing the songs and you know their voice aren't the best (umm) Meryl Streep she does a pretty good job actually she doesn't act very good in this movie, her acting's like so so, and her singing was pretty good, couple of songs pretty good (umm) so you you (stutter) might enjoy this if you like musicals (uhh) I know a lot of people did enjoy this and they really were excited about seeing this and actually wanna see this again for me I wouldn't want to see this again (umm) I didn't really like the movie, and I thought they could've I thought Meryl Streep could been done could been done a lot better at this (umm) Pierce Brosnan is actually in this movie too and he sings horribly when (stutter) he comes up the scenes that he sings, just just (stutter) close your ears run away it's it's bad
275620	132.839	136.843	-1.3333333730697632	24	 But it is as bad as I remember it's every inch as bad as I remember
275620	119.689	121.667	-1.6666666269302368	20	 (umm) I don't like this movie
275620	120.667	130.258	-0.6666666865348816	21	 I I got it in a in a set with all the other Star Trek movies and (uhh) I figured well you know, they're so inexpensive, I mine as well get this one
275620	129.258	131.974	-0.3333333432674408	22	 Maybe it's not as bad as I thought it was
275620	131.024	133.48	0.6666666865348816	23	 Maybe it's not as bad as I remember
275620	1.688	11.009	-1.3333333730697632	1	 Playing over my shoulder, unfortunately is this movie and this is Star Trek five: The Final Frontier, the two disc special collector's edition
275620	0.0	1.919	0.6666666865348816	0	Hello everyone
275620	14.987	21.315	2.6666667461395264	3	 (uhh) The fourth movie is is (stutter) known for being a very funny movie which I completely agree with
275620	11.515	15.478	-1.0	2	 (umm) This this (stutter) movie is is pretty obnoxious I have to say
275620	22.181	25.965	-2.0	5	 This movie (uhh) tries to be funny
275620	20.495	22.672	1.6666666269302368	4	 It is a very funny movie
275620	40.26	54.61	-2.6666667461395264	7	 It is about (umm) a (uhh) a Vulcan who commandeers the Enterprise, cast and crew and all, and (uhh) tries to find God at the end of space and it's (uhh) just as obnoxious as it sounds
275620	25.044	40.711	-1.6666666269302368	6	 It tries very very hard to be funny and seems as effortful in it's attempts at humor as the previous movie did (uhh) seem effortless (uhh) in in terms of being funny and this movie tries so hard to be funny and just fails at every twist and turn
275620	63.507	74.375	-2.6666667461395264	9	 The first one is kind of mediocre but the rest of em are all really good, with the exception of this one and (uhh) they followed up my beloved fourth one with this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage
275620	53.61	63.968	-2.3333332538604736	8	 It (uhh) was directed by William Shatner and he completely screws it up and it was the first movie he ever directed and they shouldn't have let him direct it because this is a franchise that I really enjoy
275620	79.022	84.801	0.0	11	 There's a commentary with William Shatner and his daughter, who wrote a book about the process of making this movie
275620	74.173	80.022	-2.3333332538604736	10	 (uhh) The special edition features for this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage (uhh) are as follows
275620	87.922	92.483	0.3333333432674408	13	 There is also a text commentary by the co-authors of the Star Trek encyclopedia
275620	84.499	88.313	-0.6666666865348816	12	 I can't wait to listen to it and listen to him try to defend himself
275620	93.389	97.342	0.0	15	 Disc two has the Star Trek universe featurettes
275620	92.341	94.389	0.0	14	 (uhh) That's on disc one
275620	102.508	111.351	-2.6666667461395264	17	 There's deleted scenes, although I can't imagine watching, wanting to watch any more of this movie outside of what's contained in the previous thing
275620	96.991	103.508	0.3333333432674408	16	 (uhh) production featurettes about previsualization models and (uhh) press conference for Star Trek five
275620	114.591	118.624	0.6666666865348816	19	 I really like watching TV spots and there's a production gallery
275620	111.418	115.591	1.6666666269302368	18	 (uhh) There's advertising, theatrical trailers and TV spots, which I enjoy watching
276217	93.988	97.652	0.0	24	 And then a bunch of others, like Tyrese Gibson, people like that
276217	97.32	102.69	0.0	25	 He's another race car driver that (uhh) John Statham's character races against and tries to win
276217	102.758	107.4	1.3333333730697632	26	 And so (stutter) this movie had a pretty good idea
276217	106.569	108.746	1.6666666269302368	27	 Like, I liked the storyline
276217	76.677	78.605	1.3333333730697632	20	 He's a really good actor
276217	78.094	88.552	0.0	21	 He's usually in action movies, like The Transporter and (uhh) a few other, like Crank, some other ones
276217	88.46	91.595	0.0	22	 (umm) Also is Joan Allen
276217	90.595	94.369	0.0	23	 She's the lady who owns the prison and the TV show
276217	109.532	116.489	-2.0	28	 (umm) But it was just too much, like, action and too much, like there wasn't, it didn't really even out
276217	115.489	118.664	-1.6666666269302368	29	 Like the acting and stuff, I don't know
276217	159.329	161.676	0.0	40	 (umm) So, yeah, Death Race
276217	163.141	170.496	-1.0	41	 (umm) Wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you really like the characters and you like action, violence, language movies, stuff like that
276217	2.765	8.075	-0.3333333432674408	1	 This is a outrageous movie that came out (uhh) in the middle of the August
276217	0.181	3.306	-0.6666666865348816	0	All right, ExpoTV, I'm going to review Death Race
276217	11.495	19.12	0.0	3	 (umm) It's about a prisoner who gets framed and he goes to he goes to (stutter) a prison
276217	7.564	11.019	-0.3333333432674408	2	 It's been out for about a little over a month now
276217	20.036	23.839	-1.0	5	 And the economy is bad and people don't have good jobs
276217	18.12	20.467	0.0	4	 It's in the future kind of too
276217	24.955	30.784	0.0	7	 And people don't have good jobs and stuff, so this guy gets framed and goes to jail
276217	22.879	25.436	0.0	6	 You find that out in the beginning of the movie
276217	31.949	35.074	0.0	9	 But that's not his job, it's just in his history
276217	29.983	32.949	0.3333333432674408	8	 And he's, like, a really good race car driver, apparently
276217	55.156	61.025	0.0	13	 And if you win all three races, then you're free and you don't have to serve your time anymore in jail
276217	150.539	155.65	-0.3333333432674408	38	 (umm) It's about a hundred and five minutes long, so about hour and forty-five minutes
276217	47.374	50.948	0.0	11	 And so he, it's like a death race
276217	34.603	47.635	-0.3333333432674408	10	 So he goes to jail and then (uhh) this (uhh) (uhh) lady who runs the jail asks him to do this TV show that's viewed by, like, everyone in the USA
276217	155.338	158.194	1.0	39	 Pretty good size movie, average
276217	49.948	56.156	0.0	12	 That's why the, you just drive around these cars with guns all over them and try and win the race
276217	62.679	68.927	0.3333333432674408	15	 And (umm) she just wants, she just wants him to race in it because (uhh) he's really good at racing
276217	60.813	62.941	-0.3333333432674408	14	 And it's really hard to win
276217	70.242	73.886	-1.0	17	 But, anyway, so, yeah, it's Death Race
276217	68.156	70.753	-0.3333333432674408	16	 But you'll find out more later in the movie
276217	131.213	135.057	-0.6666666865348816	33	 You're not going to be blown away by it or anything
276217	128.908	132.213	-1.6666666269302368	32	 But, other than that, it's really nothing special
276217	124.967	129.3	0.6666666865348816	31	 (uhh) I'd recommend seeing it if you like any of the main characters in it
276217	118.203	124.76	-0.3333333432674408	30	 The story was pretty good, though, but the overall overall (stutter) movie wasn't that great, probably like three out of five stars
276217	147.865	149.983	-0.3333333432674408	37	 Definitely not a kids' movie
276217	144.593	148.097	-0.6666666865348816	36	 (umm) So definitely want to be, like, at least seventeen to go see it
276217	139.474	144.366	0.0	35	 So it's rated R for strong violence and language
276217	135.164	139.646	-0.6666666865348816	34	 (uhh) You can pretty much guess what's going to happen (uhh) halfway through the movie
276217	75.151	77.677	0.6666666865348816	19	 That's why I saw it, because he's in it
276217	73.355	75.931	0.0	18	 (uhh) The actor is John Statham
27798	105.013	110.353	-2.3333332538604736	11	 It's not a good movie because the just the movie was bad
27798	99.615	105.883	-1.6666666269302368	10	 And (umm) this movie I would rate like you know, a two out of five
27798	122.792	128.073	-2.3333332538604736	13	 And the picture quality was really bad and just the story
27798	109.602	122.914	-1.3333333730697632	12	 The you know there were some parts in there where, you know, he's talking to his friend in some foreign language and there's no subtitles so it goes on for two or three minutes you don't even know what he's saying
27798	137.11	142.6	-2.0	15	 So again, I do not recommend this movie (uhh) at all
27798	127.452	137.761	-1.3333333730697632	14	 If I didn't know you know the the (stutter) background of Nikola Tesla I would not (umm) I couldn't follow the movie too good
27798	2.087	33.837	0.0	1	 It's a DVD, it's called The Secret of Nikola Tesla, T-E-S-L-A, and (uhh) if you don't know who Nikola Tesla is, he's the guy back in the turn of the century he worked with George Westinghouse and (uhh) some other famous guys in developing the (uhh) actually Tesla came up with the idea for the AC motor and the AC generators and motors, some electrical stuff
27798	0.899	3.087	0.0	0	This is a movie
27798	41.288	60.995	0.0	3	 This (stutters) his achievements, Nikola Tesla, lead to the discovery of the radio and television as well as the development of the first hydroelectric dam, remote control, radar tracking for the military, x-rays and manipulation of matter and energy
27798	33.415	42.128	0.0	2	 And (umm) this movie is kind of a story about his life and I'll just read some of this
27798	71.738	83.324	-1.3333333730697632	5	 And (uhh) I was seeing documentaries on Nikola Tesla's life and I much rather see the documentaries than this movie
27798	60.663	71.98	1.0	4	 So this guy was really smart guy back then and (uhh) and he made a large contribution towards, you know, the electronic age we have today
27798	86.275	99.268	0.0	7	 So it kinda you know, it's like his life from a child you know, to when he's grown up til he's dealing with all these electronic things and other powerful men like J
27798	82.324	87.275	0.0	6	 This movie (uhh) you know, is in the movie format
27798	98.268	99.747	0.0	9	 Morgan
277991	0.53	5.242	-1.3333333730697632	1	 I'd like to tell you about a movie that a friend took me to see and I didn't really like that much
277991	0.201	1.53	0.0	0	Hello
277991	11.206	19.599	0.0	3	 (uhh) People traveling are trapped in a hotel that's been quarantined for an unknown reason and they're slowly getting, you know, picked off one at a time
277991	4.721	11.507	0.0	2	 The movie is called Quarantine and the the (stutter) general plot is it's kind of a, you know, a horror flick
277991	24.595	32.49	-1.3333333730697632	5	 There's just not enough to work with there, I mean, sounds like a good place to build up some tension but they really didn't do a job in this movie
277991	19.078	25.595	-1.0	4	 Now that plot may sound familiar, I know I've seen it in a dozen other movies and frankly (uhh) none of them are that good
277991	37.795	49.521	-1.6666666269302368	7	 You know, you almost can tell anybody goes outside or comes up with a great idea or something that something bad is going to happen to them immediately, it's pretty obvious, and when it's obvious it's not scary
277991	31.49	38.297	-1.0	6	 It doesn't star anybody that I've ever heard of and I just think it was done very, very poorly
278474	5.868	21.156	0.6666666865348816	1	 Starring the (uhh) the next generation it has (uhh) (uhh) all all (stutter) the characters which I can't remember the {Laughter} names
278474	0.0	6.868	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi everybody today I'm reviewing the (uhh) VHS copy of Star Trek: Insurrection
278474	31.43	35.543	-2.3333332538604736	3	 And a lot of the movies but Insurrection was a stinker
278474	20.794	32.061	-1.3333333730697632	2	 But (uhh) it's (uhh) really this is a negative review this is one that I am sad to say I really like star trek, I liked all the spinoffs, star trek, star trek the next generation
278474	37.716	41.25	-2.0	5	 (uhh) This was given to me I would not have bought it
278474	34.643	38.516	-3.0	4	 (uhh) It was horrible I can't recommend it
278474	51.265	55.498	-1.0	7	 You know the effects are (uhh) these days there's just nothing that wows you
278474	40.789	51.766	-2.3333332538604736	6	 (uhh) It's it's (stutter) sad to say I mean you know I watched it out of curiosity just to see what was going on and and (stutter) (uhh) it's just just (stutter) a really bad story, that's all there is to it
278474	61.961	68.448	-2.3333332538604736	9	 So (uhh) I can't recommend this and I certainly wouldn't buy it
278474	54.946	62.272	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It's (uhh) nothing unusual but it is not always about effects it's about the storyline and the storyline is just boring
27ubp7CLLKQ	65.732	77.138	1.6666666269302368	12	And I have, I think that's a tremendous role model for young people, that he chose to spend years in public service, making lives better for people who didn't have opportunities.
27ubp7CLLKQ	98.059	105.234	3.0	20	Barack Obama, I think, is highly electable, and very excited and thrilled, that he is the Democratic candidate.
27ubp7CLLKQ	78.433	82.466	0.3333333432674408	14	And finally, on a very practical note, we need a candidate who is electable.
27ubp7CLLKQ	3.853	7.956	0.0	1	What do I value in a, or look for in a Presidential candidate?
27ubp7CLLKQ	12.772	17.414	1.6666666269302368	3	I just can't see otherwise, because those are so near and dear to me.
27ubp7CLLKQ	43.922	50.868	1.6666666269302368	9	I think he is highly principled, and has stuck to his values for a long time.
282560	44.44	52.225	0.6666666865348816	11	 Is he a good guy or bad guy? He goes out and punches those who have done wrong, basically by hunting them down and killing them
282560	39.921	45.44	0.3333333432674408	10	 The Punisher himself is kind of an avenging (uhh) angel, kind of in the grey area
282560	55.705	59.768	-1.6666666269302368	13	 When he's (uhh) bad it's unreadable
282560	51.943	56.705	0.3333333432674408	12	 And (uhh) just like in the comic books (uhh) when he's good he's really good
282560	61.332	63.509	-0.6666666865348816	15	 It's just a little too silly
282560	59.047	62.332	-2.0	14	 Well (uhh) when he's bad in the movies he's unwatchable
282560	67.578	73.387	-0.3333333432674408	17	 I mean, violence in and of itself is (uhh) okay, I reckon, if it's done correctly
282560	62.509	68.239	-1.0	16	 It's a very very violent movie but the violence is kind of poorly done
282560	76.697	84.811	-1.0	19	 It's more ridiculous than it is (uhh) gritty and (uhh) I just didn't think they were able to pull this movie together
282560	72.387	77.697	-1.3333333730697632	18	 But this kind of weak (uhh) I mean it's over the top violence
282560	0.261	3.615	0.0	1	 I wanna tell you about a movie I just saw in theaters
282560	0.0	0.832	0.0	0	Hello
282560	4.701	10.44	0.3333333432674408	3	 This is of course a movie based upon the popular Marvel character The Punisher
282560	2.615	5.701	0.0	2	 It's called Punisher: War Zone
282560	17.152	21.395	-1.3333333730697632	5	 This is actually not that great of a movie
282560	9.689	18.063	0.6666666865348816	4	 Punisher AKA Frank Castle is played by Ray Stevenson and he's up against his classic nemesis, Jigsaw, played by Dominic West
282560	22.021	28.778	1.6666666269302368	7	 Most of the Marvel movies have been pretty good in recent years and most of the comic book movies in general have been fairly well done
282560	20.395	22.463	-1.0	6	 I was kind of disappointed
282560	35.331	40.921	-1.6666666269302368	9	 It seems it's always getting a new cast and a new direction and it's just not working for me
282560	28.247	36.002	-1.3333333730697632	8	 This one's kind of weak, this is the third time they've made a Punisher movie and second one in recent years
282586	87.991	94.828	-1.3333333730697632	24	 And if you really want to go that route, go watch Dark Shadows reruns somewhere on TV, they have to be out there somewhere
282586	94.197	95.956	0.3333333432674408	25	 They're a lot better
282586	95.434	98.31	-1.3333333730697632	26	 So, (uhh) see something else
282586	97.46	99.338	-0.6666666865348816	27	 See a real movie
282586	75.999	79.573	-0.6666666865348816	20	 But, to me, I just wanted to go to sleep
282586	79.082	81.199	-2.0	21	 It's not a good movie
282586	80.588	82.736	-1.6666666269302368	22	 There's nothing there
282586	82.185	88.991	-0.6666666865348816	23	 And (uhh) frankly, vampires aren't supposed to be this mushy romantic characters
282586	98.338	101.962	-1.0	28	 See a real man movie, something with explosions or something
282586	1.229	4.533	0.3333333432674408	1	 I want to talk to you about a movie I recently saw
282586	0.0	2.229	0.0	0	Hello
282586	4.89	8.005	0.0	3	 Actually, (uhh) this is not your typical review
282586	3.533	5.341	0.0	2	 It's called Twilight
282586	8.542	13.463	-1.6666666269302368	5	 Do not let your girlfriend drag you to see Twilight
282586	7.005	9.023	-1.6666666269302368	4	 It's almost a warning
282586	16.464	21.345	0.0	7	 And (uhh) for some reason some of the older girls seem like to like it as well
282586	12.693	16.885	0.0	6	 This movie is aimed at young girls
282586	26.601	28.758	-1.6666666269302368	9	 There's not much of a plot
282586	20.654	27.511	-2.3333332538604736	8	 But basically this is a movie for young, teenage girls and there's nothing there
282586	36.698	40.412	-1.0	11	 She goes to a new school and she's not fitting in
282586	27.758	37.698	-0.3333333432674408	10	 It's kind of run of the mill plot of a, a (stutter) young girl who gets sent away from her parents to back to, to her, her (stutter) father who, who lives in a different town
282586	43.612	46.967	0.0	13	 But he's not a bad vampire, he's a good vampire
282586	39.412	44.612	0.0	12	 She sees a dreamy young boy and oh yeah, he happens to be a vampire
282586	48.471	53.153	-0.3333333432674408	15	 (uhh) except for some reason he's so infatuated with her he wants to drink her blood
282586	45.967	48.653	0.0	14	 He doesn't even drink people blood anymore
282586	59.346	63.38	0.0	17	 (uhh) will he? Won't he? Will she let him? (ehh) whatever
282586	52.432	59.758	-0.3333333432674408	16	 And she's so infatuated with him that (uhh) she might just let him, and that's basically the tension for the whole movie
282586	65.981	76.58	-1.6666666269302368	19	 I guess it's supposed to be some sort of romantic tension there and all the young girls in the audience went crazy for it, and I guess they thought the guy was dreamy or hot, or whatever they think nowadays
282586	62.868	66.981	-1.6666666269302368	18	 Drink blood, it's just kind of stupid
283495	4.122	7.028	0.0	1	 This is a comedy that's rated R
283495	0.55	4.294	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, you're watching my video review of Role Models
283495	13.042	20.996	-1.6666666269302368	3	 The humor in the movie feels really forced, like they're trying too hard and the writing's not very good
283495	6.457	13.433	-1.0	2	 There's a lot of cursing and crudeness but unfortunately it's not a funny movie
283495	34.244	40.172	-1.3333333730697632	5	 The character played by Sean William Scott is pretty annoying
283495	21.263	33.877	-1.0	4	 The movie is pretty formulaic, you know how the movies gonna end and I guess you could say that about a lot of movies in Hollywood but at least try to be funny along the way but this movie doesn't really deliver that
283495	57.082	63.529	-1.3333333730697632	7	 So, I would recommend looking somewhere else and not watching Role Models
283495	39.561	56.824	-1.3333333730697632	6	 Sean William Scott is Stifler in every movie that he's in, and that might've been funny back when he made American Pie like ten years ago or however long it was but, when you play the same character in every movie it starts to wear thin and just wasn't that funny
284673	86.525	98.061	-1.6666666269302368	11	 Also I went into this movie expecting at least a little bit of action considering the fact that it, it's (stutter) surrounded by a war and, you know, violence
284673	78.782	85.449	-1.6666666269302368	10	 He can do an Irish accent in Far and Away, I don't understand why he couldn't do a German accent in this
284673	100.373	106.601	-0.6666666865348816	13	 There was maybe three gunshots in the entire thing and I think they all missed
284673	98.039	101.373	-0.6666666865348816	12	 However there was none whatsoever
284673	107.806	110.602	-0.6666666865348816	15	 And that was it, it was over
284673	106.0	107.739	0.0	14	 Maybe one hit
284673	111.987	116.09	-2.3333332538604736	17	 Sorry if I ruined it for you but you really shouldn't be seeing it anyway
284673	109.702	112.308	-0.6666666865348816	16	 They caught him, the end
284673	116.167	120.52	-1.0	18	 So don't waste your time, go see something better
284673	2.585	14.261	0.3333333432674408	1	 What's up? (umm) Today I'm going to talk about a movie I saw called Valkyrie, starring Tom Cruise
284673	0.0	3.316	0.0	0	Hey expo
284673	17.621	27.361	0.0	3	 First of all Valkyrie is about a plot to assassinate Hitler before all hell breaks loose in Germany
284673	13.461	16.606	-2.0	2	 (umm) Valkyrie was a bad movie
284673	41.188	48.164	0.0	5	 Now some people would say that that's important but it is when they're trying to create suspense around it
284673	27.958	40.941	-0.3333333432674408	4	 Now most of us are pretty familiar with the history of World War Two but we know that Hitler killed himself so this is the first movie I ever went into knowing the ending
284673	55.675	61.564	-1.0	7	 Not just cause he's a nutjob, but because he really did not convince me
284673	49.818	55.717	-2.0	6	 Another thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that it starred Tom Cruise
284673	74.352	78.605	-1.3333333730697632	9	 He didn't even try, he didn't even attempt a German accent
284673	61.442	74.913	-1.3333333730697632	8	 It wasn't a German soldier trying to overthrow Hitler, it was Tom Cruise pretending to be an (stutter), pretending to be a German soldier overthrowing Hitler and we saw through that
288714	41.617	47.027	-1.3333333730697632	11	 There were no you know, got you minutes or anything like that
288714	38.853	42.397	-1.0	10	 There was no part of the movie that made you jump
288714	50.058	52.305	-3.0	13	 (umm) I didn't like the movie
288714	46.027	49.152	-2.6666667461395264	12	 I mean it was just dumb
288714	52.901	56.545	-1.6666666269302368	15	 If I saw it on TV I would change the channel
288714	51.305	53.901	-2.0	14	 I wouldn't recommend it
288714	61.182	67.68	-2.3333332538604736	17	 If you're a die hard horror picture movie person, you probably still won't like it
288714	56.832	61.534	-1.6666666269302368	16	 (umm) I would, I would (stutter) tell everybody not to waste their money going to see it
288714	70.042	72.579	-2.3333332538604736	19	 Don't waste your money in the theater
288714	66.68	70.693	-1.6666666269302368	18	 But if you still want to see it, wait for it to come on DVD
288714	9.171	14.6	0.0	1	 I kind of wondered about this movie when I saw the previews
288714	0.61	7.407	0.0	0	I went to the movies (uhh) with the people that I work with, and we saw the movie The Unborn
288714	17.122	21.195	0.0	3	 It was either gonna be really good or it was gonna be really bad
288714	13.6	17.514	0.0	2	 It was one of those ones that was gonna go one way or the other
288714	23.757	27.8	-1.6666666269302368	5	 It was one of the worst movies ever
288714	20.664	24.518	-1.6666666269302368	4	 Unfortunately, it was really bad
288714	32.238	36.75	-2.0	7	 It it (stutter) wasn't a good horror movie
288714	27.888	32.5	-2.6666667461395264	6	 The story line was completely stupid
288714	37.157	39.394	-2.0	9	 It wasn't scary
288714	35.75	38.157	-1.3333333730697632	8	 It wasn't spooky
288766	146.389	150.472	-2.0	20	 I would, overall I would have to give the movie only two out of five stars
288766	150.17	153.904	-1.0	21	 (umm) Like I said, I was disappointed with it overall
288766	153.004	160.898	0.6666666865348816	22	 But (umm) It's well worth it just to see Clint Eastwood turning into an old man and using a gun to get those darn kids off his lawn
288766	160.806	169.698	0.3333333432674408	23	 (umm) So if you are fan of Eastwood maybe check it out just to see him in what could be his last (uhh) acting role, or starring acting role anyway
288766	5.589	22.443	0.3333333432674408	1	 (umm) The movie is about a Korean war veteran, played by Eastwood, who lives in (umm) a Detroit suburb suburb (stutter) and (umm) is trying to cope with the changing of his neighborhood as several (uhh) Hmong (uhh) immigrants start to relocate into the town
288766	0.171	5.571	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, today I'm reviewing the movie Gran Torino, starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Clint Eastwood
288766	33.775	41.32	0.0	3	 (umm) And he slowly comes to terms with the changing neighborhood around him and befriends the (umm) Hmong neighbors next door
288766	22.849	33.348	0.0	2	 (umm) He is a very crotchety old man and he starts the film at his wife's funeral with his disrespectful family who he's pretty much always disappointed with
288766	47.533	52.005	0.0	5	 Both in the director's chair and as an actor
288766	42.365	48.374	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) Overall, this movie was not as great as I'd expected from (umm) Eastwood
288766	53.789	61.374	-1.6666666269302368	7	 I thought the dialogue was silly at times and it was (umm) very melodramatic film
288766	52.193	54.789	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) I was kinda disappointed with it
288766	68.027	80.122	0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) As an actor he plays jut kind of a crotchety old man, but he does turn into (umm) the (uhh) kind of the Clint Eastwood we all know and love
288766	62.25	67.6	-1.0	8	 (umm) Which was unfortunate cause I really wanted to go in to watch a great Eastwood film
288766	89.997	99.996	0.0	11	 (umm) And he deals with the repercussions of that and (uhh) his own personal feeling toward the immigrants in his town
288766	79.122	89.859	0.3333333432674408	10	 The (uhh) gun toting, don't take anything from anybody Clint Eastwood who (umm) just kind of uses violence to get his way
288766	103.187	107.19	1.3333333730697632	13	 (umm) I really enjoyed seeing Clint Eastwood as this character
288766	100.503	102.99	-0.3333333432674408	12	 (umm) The character development was okay
288766	112.805	117.187	-1.3333333730697632	15	 But overall, I really I was very disappointed with the film
288766	106.19	113.206	0.6666666865348816	14	 He was funny and very (uhh) gruff and (umm) hard to love, which makes him likable
288766	123.102	130.098	-0.3333333432674408	17	 (umm) But it was kind of a one dimensional character, even though he does kind of go through character transition that you would expect him to go through
288766	117.744	121.887	1.3333333730697632	16	 (umm) Eastwood was great in the movie
288766	144.164	147.389	0.6666666865348816	19	 But I did like his performance
288766	130.195	144.585	-0.6666666865348816	18	 (umm) And it is kind of (umm) typical kind of (umm) an ending that you would see coming if you were paying attention to the movie and (umm) kinda predictable
290088	71.788	77.448	-2.6666667461395264	11	 But obviously, I mean honestly I think that it was a terrible movie
290088	63.547	72.329	1.0	10	 The plot is basically like I said, the summary sums it up, so if that sounds interesting go watch it, I don't know
290088	76.498	87.944	-1.6666666269302368	12	 It just left me, I left the theaters just completely yawning and bored and I don't know why I just spent my money so please do not waste your money watching this movie
290088	3.054	8.375	0.0	1	 Now today I'm going to be reviewing a movie in theaters called Fired Up
290088	0.0	3.675	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey everyone on ExpoTV dot com
290088	13.82	35.493	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It's about these two guys who are tired of summer football camps and decide to scheme and go to a cheerleading camp and obviously they're surrounded by all these young women and this guy, like they start falling for them and a bunch of stuff happens
290088	8.103	14.411	0.0	2	 Now I forget who this is starring but I'll give you a little summary of what the movie's about
290088	39.661	43.275	-1.3333333730697632	5	 There was nothing really funny about it
290088	35.092	40.621	-1.6666666269302368	4	 Now overall it wasn't really that funny
290088	48.591	55.777	0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) It had a lot, here let's see, it's actually I'm not even gonna see
290088	42.535	48.015	-1.0	6	 They tried to use like sexual humor to get you to laugh but it didn't work
290088	61.112	64.547	-0.6666666865348816	9	 (uhh) it's nothing special, nothing worth seeing
290088	55.136	61.304	-2.0	8	 But (uhh) it's just overall another one of these stupid movies
29044	68.256	72.01	0.0	11	 You know, there's only a few, but the ones that they did they explained them
29044	52.921	69.256	-2.0	10	 (umm) Special features wise there's a good bit of special features but I just didn't care to see them because I didn't like the movie, so I didn't really care about the special features also, but (umm) in the in the (stutter) special features they have (uhh) a documentary on how they created some of the (uhh) some of the limited action scenes that they did
29044	75.37	82.346	-1.6666666269302368	13	 So (umm) really I wouldn't recommend this one, I don't, I don't think this was a really good movie so it's really not worth purchasing
29044	71.469	75.981	0.3333333432674408	12	 But (umm) other than that I think there's a commentary and theatrical trailer but that's about it
29044	84.769	87.565	0.3333333432674408	15	 But (umm) but yeah that that's (stutter) about it
29044	81.346	85.4	-1.0	14	 If you must see it though definitely go rent it first
29044	5.908	14.271	-1.6666666269302368	1	 Now this had Brad Pitt in it, the movie itself had Brad Pitt in it, and Robert Redford and (umm) when I watched this movie I thought it was boring
29044	0.0	6.848	1.0	0	Hey y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Spy Game
29044	17.911	24.119	0.3333333432674408	3	 I mean on the front it has this explosion and, you know, it has all this helicopter and the men moving and everything
29044	14.409	18.911	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) I, when I went into it I was thinking it was going to be, you know, this big action movie
29044	26.072	40.083	-2.0	5	 It's (uhh) more of a drama kind of movie, and I didn't really get into it at all because I was expecting it to be this huge elaborate, you know, action movie where, you know, stuff blew up and people were shooting and stuff like that, but that that (stutter) wasn't this at all
29044	23.458	26.773	-1.3333333730697632	4	 But really it's not that action packed at all
29044	43.083	45.47	-2.0	7	 It really didn't have that much action
29044	39.152	43.764	0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) It was really more of a psychological drama kind of movie
29044	48.621	53.233	-1.3333333730697632	9	 So the movie's not that good so I guess y'all should probably stay away from it
29044	44.8	49.292	-2.3333332538604736	8	 So (umm) I don't think I'd really recommend this movie, it's not really that great
291121	83.462	96.734	-2.6666667461395264	11	 I would definitely recommend that if you've read the shopaholic books to absolutely not go see this movie, and if you haven't read the shopaholic books too absolutely not go see this movie cuz it's it's it's (stutter) really awful
291121	66.201	84.122	-1.0	10	 And it's just over the top and the character of Becky is just not very strong and the acting I also thought was not very good (umm) (umm) for that character
291121	95.734	107.29	-3.0	12	 I (umm) it doesn't have a good message, no good characters, the characters are portrayed as dumb (umm) and over the top, so don't go see it
291121	9.22	14.221	0.3333333432674408	1	 And I have my ticket stub here for Confessions of a Shopaholic
291121	0.0	10.19	0.0	0	Hi Expo, today I wanna do a movie review for you of a movie currently in theaters and that is Confessions of a Shopaholic
291121	23.119	29.636	0.0	3	 (umm) And it is about a girl named Becky Bloomwood who is obsessed with shopping
291121	13.9	22.233	0.0	2	 Confessions of a Shopaholic is (umm) based on a series of novels (stutter) by Sophie Consella
291121	36.898	43.814	-3.0	5	 (umm) Very fluffy, very entertaining, but this movie was absolutely awful
291121	29.764	37.059	1.3333333730697632	4	 This particular film (umm) I've read the novels and they're really good I guess you could say chick lit
291121	49.309	60.556	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) In the novels Becky Bloomwood is, you know, I think that her character is a little bit smarter but in this movie she comes off as very dumb
291121	44.181	49.461	-1.0	6	 (umm) Which, I think you can kind of tell from the previews it's gonna be not so funny
291121	64.734	67.201	0.0	9	 (umm) I don't think
291121	60.125	64.746	-1.3333333730697632	8	 And the message at the end of the movie isn't very good
292277	57.032	62.781	-2.3333332538604736	10	 I probably wouldn't (stutter) recommend it renting it either when it comes out on DVD
292277	6.227	11.468	0.0	1	 (umm) Clive Owens is in it and to be honest with you I don't remember it very much
292277	0.0	6.339	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi everyone, today I'm doing my (stutter) review on this movie called The International
292277	14.937	23.231	-1.3333333730697632	3	 It's supposed to be kind of this like thriller drama, but half the time I didn't know what was going on
292277	10.488	15.858	-2.3333332538604736	2	 I watched it about a week ago in theaters and it was so boring
292277	41.766	44.283	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) That's the main plot line
292277	23.618	41.1	0.0	4	 (umm) He basically is a detective or works for the law and is looking for this person and these people that are in charge of a bank that (umm) supposedly trying to kill people and murder people and get away with it
292277	47.054	50.439	0.0	7	 The supporting characters didn't seem very strong
292277	43.502	48.054	-1.3333333730697632	6	 But he his (stutter) character didn't seem very strong
292277	51.933	57.982	-1.3333333730697632	9	 So I would not recommend this to anybody to go in theaters and watch
292277	49.439	52.454	-1.3333333730697632	8	 The story line was kind of boring
294178	57.64	60.995	-0.6666666865348816	11	 I didn't really catch onto anything
294178	54.996	58.221	-1.0	10	 But, you know, nothing really special
294178	70.002	74.285	-2.6666667461395264	13	 But this is not a good horror movie, I don't think, at least
294178	60.584	71.002	-2.0	12	 It was a pretty plain movie anyway {yawn} but, you know, maybe maybe (stutter) (uhh) there will be other ones that come out
294178	75.4	79.084	-0.6666666865348816	15	 You can go check at, check it out and maybe prove me wrong
294178	74.432	76.4	0.3333333432674408	14	 I might be wrong
294178	79.351	83.264	-1.3333333730697632	17	 I can't really think of anything that was that good about it
294178	78.443	80.351	-1.0	16	 I don't really know
294178	83.711	90.887	-0.3333333432674408	19	 I mean, it was entertaining to watch, but nothing really had you thinking it really, nothing special
294178	82.264	84.272	0.3333333432674408	18	 It was okay
294178	2.985	8.664	0.3333333432674408	1	 Now, today I'm going to be reviewing another movies in theaters called The Haunting in Connecticut
294178	0.0	3.546	0.0	0	Hey, everyone on ExpoTV dot com
294178	17.232	22.842	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It's basically this kid is being treated for cancer, so they relocate their house
294178	8.223	17.733	-1.0	2	 Now (umm) this is sort of, if you've ever seen the movie Poltergeist, then (uhh) this movie is pretty similar to that
294178	28.337	33.418	-0.3333333432674408	5	 And, you know, all this weird stuff goes on
294178	22.291	28.908	0.0	4	 And the house that (uhh) they move into has a dark history behind it basically
294178	41.487	47.057	-1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) Anyway, I didn't really find this movie (uhh) that good
294178	32.637	40.831	0.0	6	 And then they basically try to get help from a ghost hunter to drive, like, the evil spirits out of their house
294178	51.025	55.996	0.0	9	 You see a lot more and it kind of freaks you out and wants you to go see it
294178	46.466	51.656	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It had some creepy moments, but I was expecting a lot more from the trailer
295793	52.722	59.409	-1.0	11	 (umm) But they did not really deliver the package, so to speak, (umm) in this, in this (stutter) film
295793	43.303	52.804	1.0	10	 (umm) It did have (uhh) Turk from Scrubs fame (umm) and Avon Barksdale from The Wire so some actors that I was familiar with
295793	73.584	75.692	-0.6666666865348816	13	 (uhh) Chaos definitely happened
295793	58.678	73.886	-1.0	12	 Brief synopsis (umm) a cocaine shipment from Mexico gets delivered to the wrong apartment in Philadelphia and chaos and hilarity ensue, or at least they're supposed to
295793	78.972	89.47	-2.3333332538604736	15	 It had its funny moments but overall I would definitely not watch it again and if I had the choice I would go back and not see it
295793	75.121	79.263	-1.6666666269302368	14	 Hilarious (uhh) not so much
295793	90.955	93.032	0.0	17	 It's in theaters now
295793	89.418	91.955	0.6666666865348816	16	 (uhh) So that's, yeah Next Day Air
295793	2.246	7.008	-0.6666666865348816	1	 So regrettably yesterday I went to go see Next Day Air
295793	0.0	2.897	0.0	0	Hey there expo
295793	10.937	16.386	0.0	3	 (umm) But it was a rainy afternoon, didn't really anything to do so headed out for a matinee
295793	7.454	11.248	-1.3333333730697632	2	 (umm) One of my poorer choices, to say the least
295793	26.411	29.467	0.0	5	 So (umm) yeah
295793	15.446	27.062	-0.3333333432674408	4	 Figured, you know, lower price, can't lose too bad, right? (umm) Well I went to go see Next Day Air cause (umm) I'd already seen Star Trek and I heard awful things about Wolverine
295793	30.791	33.328	0.0	7	 (uhh) It wasn't that funny
295793	28.467	31.183	-1.0	6	 This was (stutter) supposed to be a comedy
295793	35.82	43.535	-2.6666667461395264	9	 But overall it wasn't fun to watch, (stutter) the acting was subpar to say the least
295793	32.328	36.67	1.0	8	 I mean there was some funny parts, (umm) I'll I'll (stutter) give it that
298736	116.227	123.443	-1.3333333730697632	24	 (umm) Again, it was just the thinking behind it, the story behind it, I didn't carry it as well as I needed to
298736	122.443	126.466	-0.6666666865348816	25	 So maybe I should have watched the other Harry Potter movies before I went
298736	126.105	129.579	1.0	26	 (umm) I definitely, if you ever get into it
298736	128.579	132.303	0.0	27	 Read the book, cause the book will definitely tell you what you need to know
298736	108.455	111.76	-0.6666666865348816	20	 So I had a little bit, you know, trouble catching up with that
298736	110.999	113.985	2.0	21	 The movie itself was fun, it was enjoyable
298736	112.985	115.082	1.3333333730697632	22	 It was action packed
298736	114.082	116.469	1.3333333730697632	23	 It moved along very well
298736	131.642	135.765	-0.3333333432674408	28	 I just however was not going to read that book before I watched the movie
298736	134.765	140.085	0.0	29	 So you know, it was enjoy, more enjoyable for my family who've read the books
298736	1.927	7.576	-0.3333333432674408	1	 Went and saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (umm) the other night
298736	0.0	2.548	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger
298736	11.246	13.503	0.0	3	 Have not read the books
298736	6.696	12.136	-0.6666666865348816	2	 And I will tell you I am not (umm) one of those Harry Potter fans
298736	25.204	33.517	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) So (umm) my my (stutter) review is based off of someone who is not a true Harry Potter fanatic
298736	13.082	25.625	0.6666666865348816	4	 (uhh) Have seen the other movies, but I've seen the movies because I went with my daughters, or (umm) who who (stutter) were had gotten into the books, and read the books and really (umm) you know, were a fan of Harry Potter
298736	39.671	44.263	0.0	7	 But, so I want to give you my perspective from the other side of it
298736	32.907	40.412	0.3333333432674408	6	 Okay, but went to go see a movie with a daughter that enjoyed it (umm) that it was a fanatic
298736	45.977	48.952	0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) I have seen all the movies, I did state that
298736	44.161	46.398	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) I did not read the books
298736	54.118	61.085	-0.6666666865348816	11	 (umm) Because most of the, most of the (stutter) time in the first thirty minutes, I was trying to figure out who these people were
298736	48.451	54.35	-1.0	10	 (umm) What I found with this movie, one it was two hours and thirty minutes long, which was a tad bit long for me
298736	67.518	73.297	-0.3333333432674408	13	 And if I had read the book, obviously I would know the whole story up to this point in time
298736	60.614	68.189	0.0	12	 How they related to each other, and they did talk about things that happened in prior movies, and I vaguely remember
298736	83.272	89.4	-0.3333333432674408	15	 So I did understand that you, you can't just walk in and say, and expect to catch up with everything
298736	72.876	83.963	0.3333333432674408	14	 Because what I'm, whatever number this movie is, it is a, it is the next segment in the (umm) in the series of of (stutter) movies
298736	89.907	94.249	0.3333333432674408	17	 It's, picks up pretty much, I guess where it left off of the other one
298736	88.4	90.668	-0.3333333432674408	16	 It doesn't start from the beginning
298736	102.059	109.215	0.0	19	 How did they relate? Who was that for? Were they a good guy or a bad guy? (umm) They looked familiar, those type of things
298736	144.623	152.966	-1.3333333730697632	32	 (umm) I probably would not go see it again because, again, I I (stutter) until I have some background information, it just really wouldn't work for me that way
298736	142.587	144.755	-0.3333333432674408	31	 So, it's just okay
298736	139.764	143.258	-2.0	30	 (umm) It was not, wasn't (stutter) quite as enjoyable for me
298736	152.235	155.839	1.6666666269302368	33	 Okay, that was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
298736	93.529	103.059	-1.3333333730697632	18	 So this (uhh) (uhh) was a (uhh) little bit of a hindrance for me, because like you said for thirty minutes I was trying to remember who was that person
298774	69.214	83.264	2.6666667461395264	11	 And there's just a lot of the drama going on and (umm) it's a wonderful storyline, really really interesting and (umm) it will just keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie
298774	55.056	69.705	0.0	10	 Because it's about this little girl who is dying from leukemia and there are just (umm) the family, it (umm) is just getting torn apart
298774	87.772	98.52	1.6666666269302368	13	 There's also a bestselling book called My Sister's Keeper and that's why they have the movie and (umm) it's just so good, so
298774	82.683	88.463	2.3333332538604736	12	 It's very, very good and I am so impressed with how it turned out
298774	114.092	118.624	0.6666666865348816	15	 I mean, it just shows you right there and
298774	99.076	114.314	2.3333332538604736	14	 Go watch it, I mean I just want everyone to see it because it's just so serious you can see how (umm) you can watch a girl, a little kid going through leukemia and it's just so sad but
298774	132.73	135.905	-0.3333333432674408	17	 And all that, so yeah
298774	119.3	133.73	1.3333333730697632	16	 I mean that stuff really gets to you and it was pretty serious, so (umm) I think that many people should see it so that you can see how serious leukemia is and how much it affects the family
298774	134.965	148.396	2.0	18	 It just, it opened my eyes to life and like opened my eyes to a different view on life and I know that it would open many views to other peoples and people
298774	5.599	10.51	2.6666667461395264	1	 This movie is playing out in theaters and it is very good

298774	9.799	13.343	2.3333332538604736	2	 I would give it a five star rating
298774	24.855	27.8	2.0	5	 And I was very impressed with the film
298774	20.455	25.416	2.0	4	 (umm) There are very good actresses and actors in this movie

298774	47.414	55.418	0.3333333432674408	9	 One thing that I should warn you about is the movie will probably make you cry throughout the whole film
298774	41.507	48.154	1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) I was just really impressed with this movie and I recommend it to many people

2HP4KedfmSc	33.954	44.612	0.0	3	In the 1960s, they started buying works by emerging artists, artists who weren't known but actually went on to become some of the giants of the modern art scene.
2HP4KedfmSc	16.364	34.076	1.3333333730697632	2	When people ask me for my advice about which works they should buy and how they should go about investing in emerging art, I'm always reminded of the wonderful story of Herbert and Dorothy Vogel, an American couple who lived in a small apartment in New York and didn't have much money but shared a passion for art.
2HP4KedfmSc	49.13	60.706	1.6666666269302368	5	Over 30 years, they amassed an extraordinary collection of over 4,000 works, which they donated in the 1990s to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

30162	2.805	11.737	1.6666666269302368	2	 Now this is a Brian De Palma movie that came out back in nineteen eighty four and I will tell you back in the eighties when I first saw this movie, I thought it was a pretty good movie
30162	33.096	35.633	0.0	5	 So they try to figure out how this happened
30162	26.332	33.717	2.3333332538604736	4	 I thought it was a good movie about a guy who was house sitting and actually seeing somebody get murdered and all of the sudden she's there
30162	46.047	55.966	-2.0	7	 (umm) There's a little bit hocky (umm) looking at it now the special effects were were (stutter) terrible, I mean they weren't that good at all and the story wasn't as deep as I thought it originally was

30162	64.495	106.911	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) It's not up to par with anything on today's standards and I'll tell you, I saw it again and I just I just (stutter) didn't enjoy it like I would of some of movies that, you know, that some of the other older movies so, but anyways it's called Body Double, it's rated R because its got some sexual scenes in it and some cussing in it things like this language (umm) and and (stutter) some nudity, you know and, and back in the eighties, I guess, you know when you look at the, the (stutter) (uhh) {laughter} the selection you had, this was a pretty good movie but in today's today's (stutter) standards, today's world, it really was a kinda a hocky eighties movie so I don't really recommend you go and get it or go and watch it again, there's probably some other movies that you probably rather watch instead of that
30162	55.186	64.756	0.6666666865348816	8	 So, you know, I'll take it, if you, if you (stutter) want to go back down through memory lane to see movies that were done back in the eighties, this is obviously an eighties type movie

31tcuDMQ_H8	129.497	143.537	-1.3333333730697632	15	If everyone believes that the stock market is gonna crash then it most likely already at a bottom, people have already acted on their beliefs they have already sold and theirs no more selling there is going to be a lot more buying and typically that means its at a market bottom.

31tcuDMQ_H8	30.602	38.476	0.6666666865348816	4	Its also very important what I try to observe is that you make your money when you buy the stock not when you sell the stock.
31tcuDMQ_H8	49.279	59.239	0.0	7	Many investors will look at a stock and say its down half of the value it used to be at or its at a fraction of the value and they wrongly believe that that means that's a good investment or its cheap.

34346	64.215	74.295	-1.0	13	 I mean it takes Robin Williams and shows how he's going slowly descend into this abyss of the things I've seen and it just ropes him into a conspiracy
34346	60.803	64.786	1.0	12	 It is a good idea, it's executed well to a point
34346	78.663	89.73	-2.0	15	 But just the way they ended the movie was so terrible that, {sigh} it's not even worth seeing the whole thing because it just, it just lifts you up to a point where you're just like, this is great

34346	0.75	5.771	0.0	0	The movie I will be reviewing for you right now is Final Cut starring Robin Williams
34346	14.159	20.627	0.3333333432674408	3	 See, in the near future, they have people that run a machine called the guillotine

36098	0.0	9.093	-0.6666666865348816	0	Hello, I'm here to tell you about this crazy movie Sasquatch Mountain
36098	14.907	19.459	-2.3333332538604736	3	 (uhh) This movie pretty much reeked
36098	11.645	14.511	0.0	2	 It was made for Sci-Fi
36098	30.622	34.854	-0.6666666865348816	5	 The typical Sci-Fi channel movie
36098	18.489	31.472	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (uhh) It has the typical Sci-Fi story line where they're out in the woods and there's monsters killing them one by one and you know
36098	38.683	44.363	-2.3333332538604736	7	 The graphics are bad and everything, the acting
36098	35.77	39.683	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) This movie was just pretty corny
36098	53.021	60.376	-2.3333332538604736	9	 But this movie really stunk and it's not really that entertaining
36098	43.363	53.492	0.6666666865348816	8	 I think there's maybe one or two good actors in this movie that are in some other popular movies
367506	52.382	61.045	1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) I loved the fight scenes, usually I'm not a huge fight scene fan in movies, but it was really great and had you sitting on the edge of your seat, so I really did like that
367506	49.2	52.923	1.6666666269302368	10	 They did a really, really great special effects
367506	65.153	69.316	2.6666667461395264	13	 The acting was great, they really come into their characters
367506	61.522	65.754	2.6666667461395264	12	 (umm) The special effects was great, everything looked so realistic
367506	78.752	80.7	3.0	15	 Really, really loved that part
367506	68.915	79.752	2.3333332538604736	14	 (umm) And I really my favorite part of the movie is at the end, when it has the (umm) shot into the future of what Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to be like in the future
367506	80.249	82.666	1.6666666269302368	16	 So I really recommend this movie
367506	14.498	15.868	0.0	1	 June
367506	0.49	14.95	0.3333333432674408	0	This is a review of the most recent movie that I've seen, and (umm) it was Harry Potter and I saw it on, well, I saw the midnight premiere, so it was Friday the twenty-third of July
367506	16.883	21.046	0.0	3	 And (umm) so this is my ticket
367506	15.995	17.294	0.0	2	 June
367506	24.326	34.605	0.0	5	 It says Friday the twenty-second because I saw the type of thing where you see the first part of (umm) Harry Potter seven, and then right after you see the (stutter) second part
367506	21.882	23.75	0.0	4	 Harry Potter
367506	39.611	44.443	0.0	7	 (umm) Lets you refresh the memory (umm) of what happened in the first part of the movie
367506	33.605	39.963	2.3333332538604736	6	 So the first part started at eight forty, and (umm) I really liked that because it
367506	46.396	50.2	2.3333332538604736	9	 But I really do I really did like the movie
367506	43.712	46.618	0.0	8	 But I don't think they're having that any more
367576	65.672	70.224	0.0	11	 And the supporting cast was all big names, but none of em had any roles
367576	58.319	66.183	2.0	10	 I thought Jason Momoa did as good as could be expected and I thought it's actually a fairly convincing Conan in looks and actions
367576	83.681	88.293	0.0	13	 (umm) Basically what we get is tons of hacking and slashing
367576	70.262	84.033	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (uhh) You know, Rose McGowan, Rachel Nichols (uhh) Ron Pearlman, they all had little small parts and (uhh) even the ones that had bigger parts, like Rachel Nichols, didn't really add anything to the movie
367576	96.402	111.48	-0.3333333432674408	15	 I mean this movie is just incredibly (uhh) gory and violent and while it is truer to the comics, (uhh) the comics did have plot lines and story lines and this movie, sadly, is just a convoluted mess of a plot line
367576	87.522	97.402	0.0	14	 (uhh) If you try to count how many limbs are lobbed off in this movie even if you limit it to limbs that were lobbed off by the ax, you're still gonna lose count somewhere around ten thousand
367576	111.039	118.105	1.3333333730697632	16	 So I will say that Jason Momoa did a fairly good job being Conan and looking like Conan
367576	7.195	10.43	0.0	1	 This is the latest Conan The Barbarian
367576	2.855	8.195	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, I'me here today to talk about Conan The Barbarian
367576	18.669	21.425	0.3333333432674408	3	 That's why I went to see this movie
367576	10.907	19.25	1.6666666269302368	2	 (uhh) Little background, I am a fan of the original Conan The Barbarian movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger (uhh) But I'm more of a fan of the comic book Conan
367576	29.784	39.065	1.6666666269302368	5	 But I have heard that it's closer to the comic book in the way that it was originally intended to be when it was written, and by that I mean it's a lot more animistic
367576	21.522	30.285	0.0	4	 (umm) I kinda knew that it wasn't gonna be the greatest movie in the world when I went to see it because the reviews weren't that great and it's not really doing that great at the box office
367576	45.029	49.441	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) But where this fell short was on (uhh) several points
367576	38.434	45.031	0.0	6	 A lot more goriness and a lot more hacking and slashing than your typical sword and sorcery movie
367576	51.804	59.319	-1.3333333730697632	9	 Well (uhh) I guess the acting was okay, but the dialogue they were given was not really anything that someone could work with
367576	49.12	52.395	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (uhh) First of all, the acting wasn't that great

37459	8.402	16.716	1.6666666269302368	1	 (umm) This is a science-fiction movie made by the same director of the movie Equilibrium, which was an excellent movie
37459	0.57	8.305	0.0	0	Hello, I'm Matthew, and I'm here to tell you about this DVD and it's called Ultraviolet
37459	27.858	36.042	-2.6666667461395264	3	 (umm) It's a sci-fi movie but it's very confusing, very choppy, (umm) it's kind of corny too
37459	16.324	27.511	-3.0	2	 I had high expectations, (umm) because this was, like I said, from the same director of Equilibrium and I was very disappointed
37459	43.622	49.611	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) The only redeeming thing about this movie is probably the actress that's in it
37459	35.63	43.495	0.3333333432674408	4	 And it stars the same girl that was in (umm) The Fifth Element and Resident Evil
37459	57.351	60.416	-3.0	7	 But this is a horrible movie
37459	48.93	57.513	-1.0	6	 (umm) She wears very little clothing and that's probably the only redeeming quality, is seeing her run around in (umm) belly shirts
38019	73.345	78.685	1.6666666269302368	11	 (uhh) But if you did like it and you don't have the DVD, definitely pick it up because it does have a lot of good special features
38019	70.86	73.626	0.3333333432674408	10	 Might say to rent it before you buy the DVD though
38019	6.726	17.215	-2.0	1	 (umm) Heard a lot of good reviews about it and a lot of people seem to love this movie, but (umm) when I actually went out and bought the DVD and watched it, I was really disappointed
38019	0.0	6.489	-1.3333333730697632	0	Hey my name's Scott and today I'm doing a review on a DVD that I probably should've rented before I went out and bought it
38019	20.006	26.873	-2.0	3	 (umm) I know a lot of people loved it and a lot of people think I'm crazy for not enjoying it, but it just wasn't my kind of film
38019	16.554	19.958	-1.6666666269302368	2	 (umm) I just really didn't like the movie too much
38019	30.931	38.546	0.3333333432674408	5	 But (umm) this is, (uhh) it has, it has (stutter) a decent amount of special features on it
38019	26.381	31.342	-1.0	4	 (uhh) The storyline just kind of seemed to drag until it finally got into some action
38019	60.753	66.502	0.0	7	 So, (umm) it's been compared to like The Matrix in ways like that, with sword-fighting and things like that
38019	38.294	61.205	0.0	6	" all different audios, in (uhh) Mandarin, (uhh) English, French, has subtitles in English and French, (uhh) it has the ""Making of"" special, a widescreen presentation, a conversation with Michelle Yeoh featurette, a photo montage, link to website, filmographies, animated menus, production notes, and (uhh) scene selections"
38019	68.785	71.86	0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) But, you know, you might want to give it a try
38019	66.261	68.568	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) Just wasn't really my kind of film
38374	8.412	15.269	0.0	1	 (umm) This is actually a musical which came out (umm) a few years ago so (umm) of course it's not as a famous anymore
38374	1.638	8.494	0.3333333432674408	0	Right here with me today I have the (umm) little heard of DVD called From Justin to Kelly
38374	24.975	29.636	0.0	3	 (umm) So that's of course the two (stutter) major (umm) stars in this show
38374	15.047	24.977	0.0	2	 (umm) It's got America's favorite (umm) (stutter) people from the American Idol show (umm) Kelly Clarkson and Justin (uhh) Guarini
38374	34.144	41.39	0.0	5	 It's about (umm) a few people going with their friends to Miami for spring break and then they (uhh) meet up
38374	29.245	35.144	0.6666666865348816	4	 (umm) Because these are great (umm) two very talented singers of course this has got to be a musical
38374	46.546	60.726	-2.0	7	 So (umm) I wouldn't really recommend getting this because it's (uhh) there's a reason it wasn't, it didn't get (umm) such good (uhh) ratings because it's actually quite (stutter) a boring (uhh) plot
38374	40.39	46.987	1.3333333730697632	6	 It's got a lot of music, its got a lot dancing and (uhh) basically the fun never stops in the sun
38374	66.919	88.353	0.0	9	 So if you're looking for something with a good plot (umm) I wouldn't suggest this, but maybe if you're looking for something like a sing along type I would suggest this because (uhh) the (umm) the the (stutter) subtitles actually (umm) the captions and everything actually show up as they're saying the words so it's almost like a sing along kind of movie
38374	59.726	67.919	-2.0	8	 There's not much of a plot to it, it's just (uhh) people dancing and singing on the beach and (umm) that's about it

39lcRCFvV-s	175.772	183.167	1.6666666269302368	43	 If that’s the situation I'm in as I move into my new bespectacled life as a middle-aged man, I’m sort of okay with it
39lcRCFvV-s	107.527	110.433	-0.3333333432674408	24	 I don’t know that I chose the best possible frames
39lcRCFvV-s	109.433	111.81	1.0	25	 I might upgrade those at some point
39lcRCFvV-s	110.81	117.447	1.3333333730697632	26	 And I definitely need to get non-glare lenses, since as you can see, they have a tendency to reflect the lights I use to make my videos
39lcRCFvV-s	116.447	120.38	2.0	27	 But overall, yeah, I like myself better with glasses than without them
39lcRCFvV-s	87.113	93.91	0.3333333432674408	20	 I mean, for one thing, if you tell people you’re a writer, I feel like they’re a lot more likely to take you seriously if you DO have glasses than if you DON’T
39lcRCFvV-s	92.91	99.787	1.0	21	 But also, I feel—and I know this sounds kind of stupid—but I feel like the glasses complete my face in this weird way
39lcRCFvV-s	98.787	103.199	0.6666666865348816	22	 Like I’ve never really hated the way I look, but I’ve never thought I was super good-looking either
39lcRCFvV-s	102.199	108.527	2.0	23	 And the glasses have definitely caused an improvement in my concept of my own self-image, whatever that’s worth

39lcRCFvV-s	123.072	127.264	-1.3333333730697632	29	 And that’s that … it DOES make me feel a little old
39lcRCFvV-s	159.14	166.236	1.0	40	 But it’s also made me realize that I’m pretty okay with where I am at this point in my life
39lcRCFvV-s	165.415	173.37	3.0	41	 I’m 31, I make a living as an author, I’ve got an incredible wife and three wonderful children, we got a real nice house in a real nice town in Oregon

39lcRCFvV-s	2.745	5.681	1.3333333730697632	2	 No, but clearly, something is different on my face
39lcRCFvV-s	6.197	17.284	2.3333332538604736	5	 Turns out I thought my wife really liked the goatee, but we had a conversation a couple of weeks back, and I was like, “I’m glad you like the goatee better, because I find it very fetching,” and she kind of went silent for a really long time
39lcRCFvV-s	5.18	7.197	1.6666666269302368	4	 I’m growing my beard back
39lcRCFvV-s	24.206	28.868	2.6666667461395264	7	 But yeah, she said she likes the full beard better, and I like it, too, so it’s coming back
39lcRCFvV-s	16.284	25.206	0.6666666865348816	6	 Like, so long I wondered if there was a short-circuit between my brain and my mouth and I had accidentally complimented the good looks of another woman, instead of, like, my own facial hair
39lcRCFvV-s	29.135	34.745	0.3333333432674408	9	 Yeeeah, this is still a LITTLE weird, I’m not entirely used to it
39lcRCFvV-s	27.888	30.135	1.6666666269302368	8	 Also I got glasses
39lcRCFvV-s	155.418	160.09	-0.3333333432674408	39	 The way I feel isn’t exactly a mid-life crisis, but it’s kind of akin to one

39lcRCFvV-s	39.152	48.743	0.6666666865348816	11	” So when we moved up here in August, I was driving a truck for three days straight, and I noticed that when I was driving at night, the headlights and tail lights of the other cars were getting a little bit blurry
39lcRCFvV-s	33.745	40.122	0.3333333432674408	10	 Like, I keep reaching up to adjust my glasses when they slide down my nose, and every time I’m like, “Oh my god, I'm adjusting my GLASSES
39lcRCFvV-s	53.27	62.342	1.3333333730697632	13	 So the day after my birthday I finally went to the optometrist and found out that I have a mild astigmatism, which makes long-distance vision a little bit blurry, especially at night
39lcRCFvV-s	47.743	54.27	0.3333333432674408	12	 It wasn’t anything crazy, but it was definitely a higher level of blur than I had previously experienced in my life, which was, like … none
39lcRCFvV-s	69.284	73.317	-1.3333333730697632	15	 The first day I got my glasses, I was a little bit down
39lcRCFvV-s	61.342	70.264	1.0	14	 The optometrist said I only really HAVE to wear them when I'm driving at night, but when I put them on, everything became so much clearer that I just … wear them all the time now
39lcRCFvV-s	75.769	81.788	0.3333333432674408	17	 But both of my parents had glasses since before I was born, so this is not some, like, huge surprise out of nowhere
39lcRCFvV-s	72.317	76.769	-0.6666666865348816	16	 I’ve always had perfect vision, and so it felt in a sense like I was “losing” that
39lcRCFvV-s	81.955	88.113	2.3333332538604736	19	 And after that first day, once I’d gotten used to wearing them, I found out that I actually really like how they look
39lcRCFvV-s	80.788	82.955	0.0	18	 It was pretty much inevitable
39lcRCFvV-s	128.16	131.415	0.0	31	 A lot of kids wear glasses from a very young age
39lcRCFvV-s	126.264	129.16	0.6666666865348816	30	 No, glasses are not exclusive to old people
39lcRCFvV-s	146.119	153.455	1.0	37	 Also gonna be real weird every time I go back and watch one of my old YouTube videos, which I do every once in a while, and see myself without the glasses
39lcRCFvV-s	142.966	145.523	1.0	35	 It happened because I got old
39lcRCFvV-s	140.223	143.817	1.3333333730697632	34	 But I wasn’t born with eyes that needed glasses
39lcRCFvV-s	130.415	140.135	1.6666666269302368	32	 My son Luke is getting his eyes checked in April because we’ve known for a long time that he will almost DEFINITELY need glasses growing up, and he’s finally of the age where he will PROBABLY not break them

40181	92.631	105.574	0.0	17	 It's more of a an action oriented (uhh) one liner spouting hero (uhh) has is (stutter) trapped seven hundred years in the past and in order to get out, he has to find, of course, the Necronomicon
40181	89.129	93.631	0.3333333432674408	16	 (uhh) It's more of an a action comedy than (umm) any of the other ones were horror
40181	116.297	118.544	0.3333333432674408	19	 What goes on afterwards
40181	105.482	117.297	0.0	18	 And (uhh) and many hijinx ensue with his search for the Necronomicon and (uhh) the resolutions afterwards
40260	228.432	237.853	-0.3333333432674408	24	 (uhh) (uhh) Laura Linney Jeff Goldblum, (uhh) Delacorp employees and Dan Murray as Matthias playing the lead (uhh) face of Delacorp
40260	237.442	244.528	-0.6666666865348816	25	 But honestly this movie just does not measure up, I did not, I didn't like it
40260	243.528	248.629	1.6666666269302368	26	 I liked the comedy elements I liked what he had to say I like how he handled the debate
40260	248.127	255.174	-1.6666666269302368	27	 But pretty much everything (uhh) every other character did other than Christopher Walken or Lewis Black I didn't like
40260	190.459	207.073	0.0	20	 But (umm) the lengths that the company goes to, the company by the way with the unnamed face of I believe the character's name is Matthias played by Dan Murray who's the kind of the face of Delacorp that makes sure everything goes the, according to plan
40260	206.462	209.996	0.0	21	 And his (uhh) representatives played by Jeff Goldblum
40260	209.485	215.594	2.0	22	 So at least you get good actors out of it I mean Robin Williams, Lewis Black, Christopher Walken
40260	215.122	227.277	0.0	23	 (uhh) Which also brings in more (uhh) dramatic elements you know kind of Rocky Balboa ish you know, you know push this issue because I'm going through and you'll see this, you'll see this in the movie
40260	5.349	11.767	0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) It also has the supporting characters of Lewis (stutter) Black and Christopher Walken (stutter) and Jeff Goldblum
40260	1.159	5.651	0.3333333432674408	0	I'm here to present to you Man of the Year starring Robin Williams
40260	24.516	27.391	-0.3333333432674408	3	 Weren't really people I identified
40260	11.146	24.977	0.3333333432674408	2	 But they're just the supporting characters the other two main characters Laura Linney and the guy that plays the evil face of delacorp, the company that (umm) the company that causes most of the conflict through this movie
40260	36.319	50.21	-0.6666666865348816	5	 But then there are just parts where it gets so dark and so dramatic that (umm) it just kinda overshadows any comedy that's there and just eventually becomes a straight (uhh) suspense drama you know
40260	26.761	36.82	0.3333333432674408	4	 So (uhh) if you're watching this for the comedy aspects, (uhh) it's kind of few and far between but they are funny I will say that, the, (stutter) whenever they try to be funny they are funny
40260	56.543	61.244	0.0	7	 (uhh) I've seen some of the comedy works he done (uhh) classic tv shows he's done
40260	51.604	56.685	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) Like I had complete expectations of seeing Robin Williams (uhh) stand up
40260	66.899	76.939	0.6666666865348816	9	 See the whole story behind this movie is, that Robin Williams plays a character named Tom Dobbs who has a politically charged (uhh) television show, a talk show
40260	60.763	67.59	-1.3333333730697632	8	 But this movie is just (uhh) it's, it's kind of got a conflict of interest in the story
40260	84.4	92.224	0.3333333432674408	11	 But (uhh) he tongue in cheekingly (uhh) claims that he's going to run for president
40260	76.378	84.861	0.3333333432674408	10	 Where he'll (uhh) express his opinions obviously (uhh) much like (uhh) Jon Stewart of the Daily Show or Steve Colbert of the Colbert Report
40260	101.381	109.275	1.0	13	 So he does, he runs for president and he actually gets into the, into the into the (stutter) voting system
40260	92.022	101.124	1.0	12	 And, and this is after an audience, (uhh) an audience member on one of his shows tells him to do this he decides to go through with it
40260	115.409	131.116	0.0	15	 That the movie is based around the idea that this company has created this voting system that will streamline voting making it easier for the for the (stutter) voter to just go in and just hit a few (stutter) buttons and their vote's counted
40260	109.143	115.98	0.0	14	 And (uhh) that's where the point is that earlier in the movie they showed there was a glitch in the voting system
40260	140.392	168.77	-2.0	17	 (uhh) There are a lot of elements of that which is actually what ruined the movie for me is it took it away from the comedy and made it more of a (uhh) (uhh) (uhh) the seedy underbelly of, of politics which obviously we know is there, but I just, I just wanted something about politics that didn't present that for once that actually just gave you a a (stutter) here's a a (stutter) silly, tongue in cheek rendition of what would happen if a comedian became president here's the country now, you know
40260	130.944	140.464	1.0	16	 (uhh) But a glitch is discovered early on in the movie but instead of fixing it they create this big (uhh) this big conspiracy story to cover it up
40260	179.773	190.86	-1.6666666269302368	19	 But just the direction they went with it just showed a lack of creativity and they just decided to go with the paranoia angle instead of the comedy angle, which I think they should have focused on
40260	168.189	180.244	1.0	18	 I mean some people think yeah but that would just be Idiocracy you know, which Mike Judge did that movie, but no, it wouldn't I mean Robin Williams has a lot of great points in his stand up his character also has a lot of great points which reflects
41692	8.302	14.61	0.3333333432674408	1	 Chasing Liberty is about a girl named Anna who is the president's only daughter
41692	4.94	8.604	0.3333333432674408	0	I'm reviewing the dvd Chasing Liberty
41692	25.344	41.479	0.0	3	 While she's on a trip with her parents she meets a boy and they sneak off and travel all over Europe together, and eventually she finds out that the boy had been lying to her all this time and he was really a secret service agent himself
41692	14.738	24.698	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) Anna is tired of always being followed around by secret service agents and she really wants to have some fun and enjoy her freedom before she goes to college
41692	45.438	53.881	0.0	5	 But after some ups and downs she eventually gets over the fact that he lied to her and realizes that he really did love her
41692	40.479	46.139	0.3333333432674408	4	 So by this time Anna has of course fallen in love with him
41692	59.576	66.063	1.0	7	 If you like chick flicks it's pretty good, the actors and actresses aren't bad and the storyline is kind of cute
41692	54.418	60.576	-1.0	6	 (uhh) This wasn't a horrible movie, it was just too much like every other teenage romantic movie
41692	66.031	68.588	-0.6666666865348816	8	 But it was just kind of cliche

424vOT3Nnyk	89.379	104.754	1.0	7	But above and beyond there's still one name left over, And that is the name that you never will guess; The name that no human research can discover-- But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
424vOT3Nnyk	78.714	89.379	1.3333333730697632	6	Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum, Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat, Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum-- Names that never belong to more than one cat.

45175	16.314	20.816	0.0	3	 (umm) I would give this movie about a five out of ten
45175	13.092	15.648	0.0	2	 It also has Andy Dick in it
45175	27.22	33.557	0.6666666865348816	5	 I would say it's for (umm) people between the ages of about thirteen to twenty-five in that range
45175	21.562	27.531	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) The acting wasn't any particularly very good and it wasn't very funny, it's supposed to be a comedy
45175	57.122	63.1	0.0	7	 So he starts out working really hard trying to get employee of the month so he can win the girl
45175	34.134	57.643	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) It had its moments but for the most part it's just one of those (umm) stupid comedies (umm) it's about a employee of this like, store who (umm) does slacks off a lot and (umm) this really pretty girl, Jessica Simpson, who moves to the store and he finds out that she really likes employees of the month
45175	73.474	78.765	-1.0	9	 And so it's kind of entertaining but I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you're pretty bored
45175	62.829	73.786	-0.3333333432674408	8	 And so he runs and he also has an, an (stutter) enemy in the store who's also trying to get employee of the month and so they fight over the position
45184	11.126	14.85	-3.0	1	 (umm) I thought this movie was really, really bad

45676	34.074	47.785	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) The directing was okay, but I don't know if they were trying to make it (umm) sweet and romantic but it kind of comes off a little creepy, a little weird
45676	53.849	75.622	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) Late thirties and it comes off kind of creepy, there's (umm) (umm) a nude scene involving her and the young child and she's going to run away with him and (umm) they kiss in the movie and, and instead of coming off sweet and endearing it comes off a little (umm) weird and really creepy and a little uncomfortable
45c3QQzGakM	25.244	32.041	0.6666666865348816	5	Whereas online are either growing or, and even this economy, look like they're actually going to continue to grow.

46497	6.656	10.939	-2.6666667461395264	1	 I mean obviously I watched this because I hate myself
46497	1.338	7.576	-1.3333333730697632	0	I've got to wonder who out there is watching Steven Seagall movies
46497	25.364	44.912	-2.0	3	 And (uhh) I have to actually restrain myself on the couch before I put the movie (uhh) on play to watch it because otherwise I just end up throwing whatever I can find at the tv in an effort to (uhh) (stutter) break it whatever, his smug fat face comes on the camera
46497	10.707	26.005	-1.6666666269302368	2	 But (uhh) somebody out there has to be buying these and (uhh) actually enjoying them, so that they continue to buy more of them because he keeps on making movies and I can't figure it out because they're terrible
46497	44.81	57.293	0.0	4	 (uhh) I guess I should get to the point this movie Black Dawn, (uhh) he plays a ex-CIA agent, (uhh) has to (uhh) stop terrorists from releasing a nuclear weapon
46604	11.296	22.702	-2.6666667461395264	1	 (umm) I guess the answer is probably no, because (uhh) this is maybe the (stutter) one of the worst movies I've seen him in so far, and that's saying a lot for (uhh) Wesley Snipes
46604	0.5	9.203	-2.0	0	I'm (uhh) sitting here trying to figure out if I've ever seen a Wesley Snipes movie that I enjoyed
46604	25.863	28.21	0.0	3	 (uhh) It's ninety-five minutes long
46604	22.111	25.975	0.0	2	 This movie is called The Marksman, this is the DVD release
46604	31.819	36.371	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) It is high-def but (uhh) doesn't matter, it's a bad movie
46604	27.599	31.502	-1.3333333730697632	4	 There are no special features on here at all
46604	51.235	53.961	-1.0	7	 (uhh) Like I said, there's no special features on here
46604	37.157	48.952	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) He plays a special forces soldier who has to go stop Russian terrorists at a nuclear power plant and (uhh) there, you've seen the whole movie
46604	53.56	60.726	-1.0	8	 (uhh) I really didn't care that much because I wouldn't have wanted to see them anyway, but (uhh) this movie is just a real stinker
46618	5.05	13.952	-1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm), If you've seen Lake Placid, or Anaconda, or any of those, this is basically just a, a rip-off of those

46618	22.45	32.18	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (umm), The first thing going against it is that there stars Casper Van Dien, who in my opinion, has never been good in anything except for maybe Starship Troopers
46618	13.391	22.323	-1.6666666269302368	2	 And, (uhh), since it's ripping of a couple of pretty poor movies, it's probably no surprise that this one's even worse
46618	35.082	39.923	-2.6666667461395264	5	 (uhh) Which may be a blessing because once the movies over you wouldn't want to see anymore anyway
46618	32.537	35.104	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm), There's no special features on the disc

46618	39.152	47.815	-2.6666667461395264	6	 But, (uhh), this movie is basically about an hour and a half of (uhh), poorly done special effects
46618	52.093	54.919	-2.0	8	 I know that sounds good but (stutter) it's not
47472	85.138	90.737	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) But as for the movie itself, (umm) I didn't really care for it

49358	78.782	83.903	-1.0	13	 I give (uhh) the modern Gone in Sixty Seconds two out of five
49358	69.184	79.124	0.3333333432674408	12	 (uhh) Ultimately if you haven't seen it, if you haven't seen Gone in Sixty Seconds go rent this original seventies version, you'll probably get more entertainment out of that
49358	3.194	5.641	0.0	1	 This is Nicolas Cage
49358	0.39	3.935	0.0	0	Hey, what's up? Okay, today I'm going to be reviewing a movie
49358	7.933	33.088	0.0	3	 Gone in Sixty Seconds is a remake of a seventies film by the same name and basically it's about a car a car (stutter) thief gang that has to steal a certain number of cars within a short period of time, and (uhh) this movie involves a lot of car chases obviously, and it involves a lot of fast cars, a lot of fancy cars
49358	4.87	8.464	0.3333333432674408	2	 He's in this movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds
49358	34.134	40.262	1.0	5	 If you like (uhh) if you like that kind of thing then this, this movie could be for you
49358	32.088	35.134	0.0	4	 You'll see lots of Ferraris and Lamborghinis
49358	43.123	46.997	-1.3333333730697632	7	 I've been disappointed by Nicolas Cage many times
49358	39.262	43.415	-2.0	6	 I was actually disappointed, I was hoping for a lot more, I don't know why
49358	51.604	59.419	-1.6666666269302368	9	 I don't think he (uhh) I don't think he really cares about making good movies, he cares about making movies that make money
49358	47.164	52.604	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (uhh) Also this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film and (umm) I don't really like Jerry Bruckheimer
4AQC7_uCuEE	137.629	143.078	-0.3333333432674408	24	 You'll be surprised how quickly your adolescent will back down once you back down
4AQC7_uCuEE	142.717	150.023	0.0	25	 So it's a matter of choosing which of the situations are very very serious and need your attention - - and which don't
4AQC7_uCuEE	149.023	153.305	0.0	26	 So let's go back to the bedroom problem
4AQC7_uCuEE	152.754	162.375	1.0	27	 What is my suggestion about the way you handle the bedroom that just never gets cleaned? I suggest you just close the door
4AQC7_uCuEE	111.259	118.754	-0.6666666865348816	20	 There are going to be situations that come up between you and your adolescent that you've got to respond to and there's gonna be problems
4AQC7_uCuEE	117.913	127.324	1.0	21	 As long as you're careful and you pick those battles very wisely, you can guide them and teach them and help them as they mature through this process
4AQC7_uCuEE	127.402	133.251	-0.3333333432674408	22	 But sometimes the battle is just not worth it, it's not that important
4AQC7_uCuEE	132.999	138.03	0.3333333432674408	23	 And so what you can do in those situations, is back down, let it go by
4AQC7_uCuEE	15.875	24.887	1.0	1	 So what is the parent supposed to do? My suggestion to you is to pick your battles very wisely
4AQC7_uCuEE	-0.488	16.875	-0.3333333432674408	0	How many times do I have to tell you to clean up your room? Sound familiar? Your adolescent is going to test you in many ways - from a challenge to clean up their room, to your position on world peace
4AQC7_uCuEE	37.237	42.078	0.3333333432674408	3	 So how to do that? I have three points for you
4AQC7_uCuEE	24.755	38.237	1.3333333730697632	2	 Not every situation requires a big battle, and it's important for parents and adolescents to navigate those waters and figure out which battles are worth fighting
4AQC7_uCuEE	41.836	44.842	0.3333333432674408	4	 First point, most important point
4AQC7_uCuEE	49.609	54.6	0.3333333432674408	9	 Give yourself a few minutes to sort out the situation
4AQC7_uCuEE	48.262	50.339	0.0	8	 Take a step back
4AQC7_uCuEE	55.226	67.829	0.0	11	 As you're considering what to do about this reaction from your adolescent, I suggest you begin by looking at yourself
4AQC7_uCuEE	71.968	85.739	0.3333333432674408	13	 Why are you feeling the way you're feeling? What is the serious part about this? And what is just the emotional part about this? You kind of have to sort yourself out first, so then you can move ahead and deal with the situation

4HAC00EAdno	65.433	85.908	0.6666666865348816	10	But in fact you don’t need the graphs, as long as you keep the following in mind: given an inequality, you must find the x-values where both sides are equal, in this case x=-sqrt(2) and x=sqrt(2). But also find x-values where the functions involved are not defined or discontinuous.
4HAC00EAdno	101.551	106.861	0.6666666865348816	13	On each interval either the inequality holds for all points, or for none of them.

4HAC00EAdno	24.087	35.972	0.3333333432674408	4	Remember: the boundaries of these intervals can be points at which both sides are equal, that is, where the graphs intersect, but also points where one of the functions is not defined or discontinuous.

4Kh5N9W-Jr4	2.496	10.45	1.3333333730697632	1	 My name is Andi and today what I wanted to do was a one-minute video on averages vs medians
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	0.0	3.456	1.3333333730697632	0	[Music] Hi, Welcome to Wave Domain
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	18.429	25.935	0.6666666865348816	3	 Averages - very simple - take the total sales and divide by the count and that gives you a number that is the average
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	9.699	19.03	0.6666666865348816	2	 Now, I refer to both of these terms quite a lot when i'm doing the trend analysis and looking at the sales data so i thought it would be good good idea to make sure that we're on the same page with what this means
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	27.489	35.393	0.6666666865348816	5	 Cos what you're gonna do is you're going to line up all the sales in ascending order and go to that one that the halfway point and that's going to be your median
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	25.334	28.489	0.3333333432674408	4	 Now, medians are a little bit more democratic
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	50.437	58.331	1.3333333730697632	7	 Averages are very useful indicators but you tend to get blown around by those higher numbers at the top end
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	34.673	50.289	0.3333333432674408	6	 Now they are much less skewed, medians, are much less skewed by really giant sales at the top end and so that sometimes is a much better indicator of what you might expect to get for one of your names on a typical sale
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	62.829	65.455	1.6666666269302368	9	 Thanks for watching Wave Domain
4Kh5N9W-Jr4	57.71	63.759	0.6666666865348816	8	 So that's my 52 second definition of averages vs medians

52068	117.115	118.415	2.0	21	 Okay
52068	1.777	7.626	0.3333333432674408	1	 I want to tell you (stutter) a little bit about this movie called The Karate Kid III
52068	0.0	2.777	1.3333333730697632	0	Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger
52068	8.971	13.972	-0.3333333432674408	3	 They have continued making these sequels to The Karate Kid
52068	7.065	9.801	0.6666666865348816	2	 Okay? Yes, that's right, part III
52068	15.426	31.522	0.3333333432674408	5	 It had (umm) Pat Marita and Ralph Macchio, and it was Daniel-san and his sensei, Myagi, and it was about how they first met, how they (umm) fought, (umm) I mean, how he taught him how, Myagi taught Daniel how to do karate
52068	13.311	16.097	0.6666666865348816	4	 Now, the first movie was great
52068	42.066	52.973	1.3333333730697632	7	 Well, the third one here (umm) with the same characters, which is good because it has the same exact characters, it just keeps going on and on, (umm) it talks about this feud
52068	30.831	42.786	-0.6666666865348816	6	 The second one was, you know, took it down the next road, where they went to, back to (umm) Okinawa and, you know, (umm) Myagi, they got hooked up in some kind of feud
52068	55.765	62.043	0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) Daniel wants Myagi to help him get ready for a tournament and (umm) Myagi doesn't want to do it
52068	51.973	55.966	0.0	8	 Now Myagi and Daniel are kind of on opposite ends
52068	63.956	71.631	0.0	11	 And the guy who Daniel ended up going to is an old nemesis of Myagi's, and so you got that drama there
52068	61.043	64.956	0.3333333432674408	10	 So it's it's (stutter) about them being on opposite ends
52068	75.659	78.166	0.0	13	 (umm) the original Karate Kid
52068	70.98	76.041	-1.0	12	 Okay? But it's just it's just (stutter) not as good as the originals
52068	83.651	87.425	0.3333333432674408	15	 But it is (umm) you know, it does star the same people
52068	77.894	84.322	0.6666666865348816	14	 But I'll tell you, I mean, if you're watching them, you might as well go ahead and see the, you know, all of the Karate Kids as they go into it
52068	91.114	98.47	1.3333333730697632	17	 But it's it's it's (stutter) worth just taking a look if there's no other thing out there to watch and you've, you (stutter) get the whole set
52068	86.425	91.805	0.0	16	 It is rated PG because it's dealing with fighting and karate and things like that
52068	99.904	106.831	-1.0	19	 But, like I said, the farther down you go on the sequels, they don't quite get as good as the first one was
52068	97.56	100.625	-0.6666666865348816	18	 Okay? Just so you can kind of see it
52839	68.665	71.441	0.0	11	 And Matt Damon plays Private Ryan
52839	63.766	69.356	0.0	10	 And so the whole story takes place them trying to decide that for themselves as they go and find him
52839	75.699	78.715	1.6666666269302368	13	 It, you won't, you won't (stutter) fall asleep in this one
52839	70.701	75.821	1.0	12	 And (uhh) overall I'd say it's a great movie, it definitely entertaining even though it's long
52839	2.945	5.262	2.6666667461395264	1	 This movie rules
52839	0.331	2.707	0.0	0	Saving Private Ryan
52839	11.665	20.836	1.0	3	 (uhh) It's two hours and forty-nine minutes long, and (uhh) it's pretty much on every top hundred list in the world for movies
52839	5.249	11.577	1.0	2	 (umm) It's won so many awards, it was the best grossing (uhh) highest actually, highest grossing film of ninety-eight
52839	30.502	36.211	0.0	5	 So it starts off (umm) with the invasion of Normandy
52839	21.203	31.163	2.6666667461395264	4	 (umm) Steven Spielberg won a ton of like, (uhh) highest honors from the army and stuff like that too, that that's (stutter) how good this movie was, like it was very realistic and it told from the perspective of a soldier
52839	42.744	52.155	0.3333333432674408	7	 And so Tom Hanks is the main character and his goal to the entire thing is to find Private Ryan and bring him back to his mom so that she doesn't lose four sons
52839	35.531	43.405	-0.6666666865348816	6	 And the problem is (umm) Private Ryan has three brothers in the war as well and they all die
52839	60.494	64.497	-0.6666666865348816	9	 Why are we saving one guy and there's eight of us risking our lives for this one guy
52839	52.682	61.234	-0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) And they, and (stutter) embark on the epic journey where they're trying to decide why are we trying to save this one guy, it's it's (stutter) a war, like people die
53742	118.362	121.647	-1.3333333730697632	11	 But other than that I really didn't care for it
53742	109.912	118.804	0.3333333432674408	10	 And so for that reason some some (stutter) people may to want to watch it just to see the, you know, the social life of that era
53742	5.17	10.071	0.0	1	 (uhh) It stars (uhh) Ben Chaplin and Jennifer Leigh
53742	0.51	4.942	-0.3333333432674408	0	Wanted to review this movie Washington Square
53742	14.468	47.356	0.0	3	 And you have an (uhh), let's see upper class (umm) doctor and (uhh) and his homely daughter and (uhh) (stutter) you have this charming (uhh) guy that comes along, played by Ben Chapling, Chaplin, who is (umm) you don't know if he really loves the homely daughter or if he's out for her money and so that's the plot of the story
53742	9.899	14.561	0.0	2	 And it's a story that takes place in the eighteen hundreds in New York
53742	52.113	76.849	-2.0	5	 I think the story (stutter) I think the movie is like an hour and fifty-five minutes but the whole, the whole time (stutter) you're waiting to, and you're waiting (stutter) and thinking that something's going to happen that's going to make the show interesting and before you know it the show is over with and that exciting thing never did happen
53742	48.082	52.434	-2.0	4	 And (umm) it's really a boring story
53742	86.036	94.369	0.0	7	 (uhh) But you can get, you know, you can get Washington Square at Amazon dot com or you can borrow it and rent it
53742	77.026	85.609	-1.0	6	 So (umm), you know, I found it boring and I would probably give it, you know, maybe a three out of five rating
53742	107.387	110.592	-0.3333333432674408	9	 That was, that was (stutter) really interesting
53742	93.619	108.288	0.6666666865348816	8	 Some people may like it because (umm) it's in the eighteen-hundreds, maybe mid eighteen-hundreds to late eighteen-hundreds and so (umm) it's interesting watching the social life of that era

55156	42.644	51.826	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (uhh) I could see like maybe like attack eagles on a plane, because you know, eagles fly and planes fly but like snakes on planes you just, it's a concept that's really out there
55156	34.074	42.946	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (uhh) Personally I thought it was pretty (uhh) it was just really corny, and I mean it's kind of interesting to see what they could possibly do with snakes on a plane
55156	51.774	58.84	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (uhh) And then the snakes, it's just, it's kind of a more low budget film, the CG snakes, computer generated so they're not very realistic
55156	2.855	6.499	1.6666666269302368	1	 (uhh) Pretty funny movie, (uhh) pretty corny movie actually
55156	0.031	2.418	0.0	0	Today I'm reviewing Snakes On A Plane
55156	8.352	11.418	-1.0	3	 Jackson would agree to do a movie quite like this
55156	5.609	9.352	-1.0	2	 (umm) I'm very surprised that a actor notorious as Samuel L
55156	18.479	22.662	0.0	5	 (uhh) Basically starts out, a guy witnesses a murder
55156	11.016	18.532	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (uhh) I guess you know money's money so if you get paid for this movie you get paid for something else and you don't really have to try to act too hard in this movie
55156	22.061	25.256	0.6666666865348816	7	 Jackson's an FBI agent, gonna protect him
55156	21.662	23.061	-1.0	6	 Samuel L

55T4QNcdpOk	18.07	28.878	-0.6666666865348816	4	What we got was a lot of expensive instruction in business ethics at business schools and that didn't make businessmen any more honest.
56006	58.798	62.112	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) So, I wouldn't really (stutter) recommend this movie
56006	44.241	58.521	-2.0	10	 There's just nasty blood and guts and disgusting things hanging out all over this spaceship that basically goes to an alternate dimension, or hell, and then comes back and then these people go and try to rescue it because they think it's been a long lost (uhh) spaceship
56006	61.112	62.971	-2.0	12	 I don't think it was very good
56006	2.007	5.381	0.0	1	 This is the (uhh) the special collector's edition
56006	0.281	2.827	0.0	0	Today, I'm reviewing Event Horizon
56006	15.456	26.164	1.6666666269302368	3	 (uhh) Event Horizon it's a really cool concept actually event horizon's actually (uhh) the point in space in which you can't get sucked or which outside of you cannot get sucked in to a black hole
56006	4.381	15.778	0.3333333432674408	2	 It stars (uhh) Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, and (uhh) also Joely Richardson, who is (uhh) the who stars in (uhh) Nip Tuck, which is a great show
56006	28.487	30.245	0.0	5	 It's kind of a sphere
56006	25.164	29.487	0.6666666865348816	4	 So it's basically the (uhh) the furtherest extent of a black hole
56006	37.566	40.651	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (uhh) But it's just, it's just (stutter) a really gross movie
56006	30.492	37.878	1.6666666269302368	6	 (umm) So it's a really cool concept in terms of the (uhh) the science behind it and then, you know, what happens if you were to get closer
56006	43.373	45.241	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) But it's real gross
56006	39.651	42.966	-0.3333333432674408	8	 It's one of those movies that like it's scary movie, too
56276	56.044	66.892	-2.0	11	 (umm) I mean there's some stupid funny movies out there but this (umm) I mean it it (stutter) you had to have the maturity of maybe a five year old to really, really think this is a funny movie
56276	52.432	56.356	-2.6666667461395264	10	 I just remember it was just so ridiculously stupid
56276	72.008	75.642	-2.0	13	 It's not worth the ten dollars, it's not worth the five dollars
56276	66.211	73.008	-2.3333332538604736	12	 So I will tell you Dana Carvey's Master of Disguise, if you see it just keep right on going
56276	78.563	85.02	-3.0	15	 So don't even think about it, don't look at the name of it except the fact of saying ooh never get that movie
56276	74.891	79.254	-2.6666667461395264	14	 If someone gives you the movie it's not worth the time to even watch it
56276	2.057	9.053	-0.6666666865348816	1	 I want to tell you a little bit about this (uhh) movie called the Master of Disguise
56276	0.0	3.057	1.0	0	Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger
56276	15.556	25.905	-3.0	3	 This is one of the most stupidest movies, (umm) and it was a complete (umm) insult for me to even watch it
56276	8.791	16.027	-3.0	2	 Now I will you that this is probably one of the biggest wastes of ninety minutes that I've ever done in my life
56276	26.212	29.776	-2.0	5	 So I will tell you don't bother
56276	24.905	26.743	-2.6666667461395264	4	 It was that dumb
56276	30.871	35.932	0.0	7	 Now Dana Carvey, I mean he's the, you know (stutter) it's, he's the main guy in the movie
56276	29.265	31.871	-2.3333332538604736	6	 If you see it keep walking by
56276	39.402	53.432	-1.6666666269302368	9	 But in this movie he's a detective and he's in all, he goes in all kinds of different disguises to to to (stutter) do (umm) to to to (stutter) go after the bad guy, I can't remember exactly, I don't even remember why he's going after him
56276	34.932	39.993	0.0	8	 Now I I (stutter) used to watch him on Saturday Night Live and, you know, it was funny
57618	50.117	56.585	-1.6666666269302368	11	 He has a lot of one-liners and he's confused a lot of the movie
57618	42.515	49.97	-1.6666666269302368	10	 Keanu Reeves Keanu Reaves' acting was like a lot worse than the first two movies
57618	63.497	81.119	-2.3333332538604736	13	 (uhh) There's this one fight with Neo and Agent Smith that like (stutter) there was like a billion Agent Smiths but he only fought one so it was kind of disappointing cause I I (stutter) thought it would be a crazy fight with every Agent Smith against Neo, but no, it was just one
57618	59.267	62.482	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (uhh) {clears throat} He (stutter) doesn't show a lot of emotion
57618	84.749	88.483	-2.3333332538604736	15	 It was basically a rip-off of Dragon Ball Z
57618	82.324	85.37	-1.6666666269302368	14	 (umm) And that fight was kind of disappointing
57618	90.516	98.54	-1.0	16	 (umm) The DVD has some extra features, some behind the scenes stuff but I don't think that makes it worth buying
57618	4.561	8.035	0.0	1	 This is the final movie in the Matrix Trilogy
57618	0.0	4.234	0.0	0	Hi, I'm here with The Matrix Revolutions

57618	7.674	10.55	-1.0	2	 I'm giving this movie a two out of five
57618	19.188	22.662	-2.3333332538604736	5	 I felt they could have ended the trilogy so much better
57618	16.723	19.499	-2.0	4	 However I did not like this third movie
57618	26.521	35.543	-1.6666666269302368	7	 One in the real world and one in the matrix and it (stutter) didn't feel like that much happened in this movie
57618	22.251	27.521	-1.0	6	 Almost the entire movie was like (stutter) two battles
57618	40.709	43.475	-1.6666666269302368	9	 The dialogue was pretty bad
57618	34.543	41.12	-2.0	8	 The movie just felt like really short and (stutter) the ending just wasn't that good
59333	44.101	51.467	-0.6666666865348816	11	 If you don't like the show, you will not like this movie but you won't dislike it as much as you like the show

59333	57.9	65.335	-2.3333332538604736	15	 I wanted to leave but I couldn't because I was there with a friend and she would not leave and she paid for my ticket so how could I really leave

59333	70.601	77.507	-1.3333333730697632	17	 So I would just say that (uhh) do not see it {laugh} if you don't like the show
59333	66.251	70.733	-1.3333333730697632	16	 (umm) I really have no further comment on this movie because I zoned out for most of it

59333	7.584	13.224	-2.0	1	 (umm) Let me first off start by saying that I absolutely hate the show Aqua Teen
59333	0.0	6.389	0.0	0	I will now be reviewing Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie For Theaters

6q5uKCgairk	80.977	107.499	1.0	6	 One of the benefits that the Media Fellow, Alexa, brought to the capstone course -- for me she is just an ideal, model student because she understands that the things that she's bringing into class, her assignments, go beyond simply doing an assignment, beyond getting a grade, beyond staying within the confines of the University
6q5uKCgairk	119.091	129.09	0.6666666865348816	9	 So she's always had this forethought of seeing that this is what I'm doing now and this is how it needs to work in the future

72385	91.763	95.387	-0.6666666865348816	23	 Not gonna even give it an okay rating
72385	4.86	7.686	-1.6666666269302368	1	 I didn't say force, I said farce
72385	-0.488	5.002	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, today I'm (stutter) reviewing the movie Delta Farce
72385	7.484	11.577	0.0	2	 Stars Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D
72385	11.435	18.392	-3.0	5	 This has got to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen
72385	10.577	12.036	0.0	4	 Qualls
72385	25.942	27.92	-1.6666666269302368	7	 Worthless people
72385	19.158	26.084	-1.0	6	 There's three reservists, old time reservists from the south, drunk
72385	32.398	36.012	0.0	9	 On their way to Iraq in a plane
72385	28.237	33.398	0.0	8	 And they (uhh) have their big, get orders to be sent to Iraq
72385	40.729	42.976	-0.6666666865348816	11	 I mean a military jeep
72385	35.72	40.941	-0.3333333432674408	10	 They decide they don't want to sleep on the plane so they go back and sleep in a military jet
72385	47.164	50.16	-0.3333333432674408	13	 They wake up, and they think they're in Iraq
72385	43.313	48.164	0.0	12	 Well sure enough the jeep gets dropped in the middle of the desert some place
72385	52.263	58.082	-0.3333333432674408	15	 So they start a war in Mexico against some rebels
72385	49.778	52.215	0.0	14	 But instead they're in Mexico
72385	63.737	68.159	-2.6666667461395264	17	 (uhh) A lack of taste, (uhh) what other bad words can I think of
72385	58.039	62.901	-3.0	16	 It's dumb, it's stupid, it's boring
72385	72.846	77.667	-1.6666666269302368	19	 So I think they should've dropped the word delta and just went with the farce
72385	68.556	72.878	-3.0	18	 (uhh) I've never seen a movie like this, I don't want to see another one like it
72tXTrSXoMk	54.049	55.956	2.3333332538604736	10	We had a great time
72tXTrSXoMk	15.406	26.094	0.6666666865348816	3	some plants have a 'C,' some plants have a 'T' And we think that this position, whether they have a C or a T, determines which Rhizobia they interact with
72tXTrSXoMk	11.665	16.187	0.3333333432674408	2	And you can see here at position 396, there's variation
72tXTrSXoMk	31.061	38.835	0.0	5	When faced with the choice of bacterial partners in the soil, plants have genes that can determine which bacteria get into their root nodules, and which ones don't
72tXTrSXoMk	25.553	31.632	0.3333333432674408	4	So while Rhizobia strains can vary in how they treat their host plants, plants are not powerless in this relationship
72tXTrSXoMk	40.988	46.578	0.3333333432674408	7	Here on the left, this plant is interacting with the more beneficial strain, making a good choice
72tXTrSXoMk	38.554	41.599	0.6666666865348816	6	Different plans genotypes choose different bacteria
72tXTrSXoMk	52.302	55.049	2.0	9	Katy, thank you so much for being on this episode
72tXTrSXoMk	45.997	53.302	1.3333333730697632	8	So here on the right, this plant is allowing the less beneficial rhizobia to infect the nodules as well
73447	72.696	79.174	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) Never got really into the movie (uhh) because it was just so distracting, and not immersive
73447	53.879	72.858	-1.6666666269302368	10	 Dogville (umm), you know from the back of the cover seemed to be kind of interesting, but the way that the screenplay and they set it up basically was a stage act with little more than props as furniture and also black backdrops just to sort of see this whole thing play out
73447	82.863	85.39	-1.0	13	 Especially since it's a movie you know
73447	78.174	83.863	-2.0	12	 It felt like you were sitting in a theater and (umm) sort of tricked into it
73447	87.732	93.082	-2.0	15	 I would not recommend it, especially if you thought it was a movie
73447	84.809	88.473	0.0	14	 So (umm) It's rated R
73447	94.078	97.432	-2.3333332538604736	17	 So Dogville, one out of five stars
73447	92.312	95.078	-1.0	16	 Well, it's not even a movie at that
73447	0.081	3.945	0.0	1	 This is Dan with my review of Dogville on DVD
73447	0.0	1.081	0.0	0	Hi
73447	4.282	6.549	-3.0	3	 This movie sucked
73447	3.633	5.142	-2.3333332538604736	2	 Ouch
73447	15.945	27.771	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (uhh) It earns a hearty one out of five stars in my opinion, even though it stars a (uhh) well known and, I think personally, great actress, Nicole Kidman
73447	6.636	16.157	-1.0	4	 (umm) If there was a movie that could be any worse than this, I'd probably call it a play, which is what basically this was as a movie
73447	32.068	42.477	-2.0	7	 It felt like you were looking at Harry Potter's little map, his magic map, with people walking around, and that was the set and that was the whole movie
73447	27.0	32.849	-1.0	6	 I just think the whole setup of Dogville (uhh) just, it was weak
73447	52.293	54.5	-2.6666667461395264	9	 Very disappointing
73447	41.906	52.814	-1.0	8	 Yes, we had to actually fast forward this chapter by chapter just to make sure there was never going to be any real scenery or real set to look at
73449	69.773	81.598	-0.3333333432674408	11	 Definitely not fun when you're not playing a video game and attacking everything yourself, but watching other people get spun into cocoons, eaten, and (uhh) maybe some of these spiders getting attacked
73449	62.769	70.294	-0.3333333432674408	10	 And (umm) basically they're all in the mall and these things are attacking and seriously I thought I was playing a video game
73449	86.006	91.635	0.0	13	 It's rated PG-thirteen for sci-fi violence, brief sexuality and language
73449	80.748	87.006	-2.6666667461395264	12	 So, one out of five stars is my opinion of this movie, do not rent it, do not buy it
73449	90.925	93.371	-2.6666667461395264	14	 But definitely not worth your time
73449	3.493	12.954	-1.3333333730697632	1	 And I hadn't even heard about this movie until I actually saw it on tv once and I thought man, that is the worst movie I'd ever seen what is it
73449	0.44	4.493	-0.3333333432674408	0	Hi this is Dan with my review of Eight Legged Freaks on DVD
73449	16.185	20.198	0.6666666865348816	3	 From the producers of Independence Day and Godzilla
73449	12.293	16.865	0.3333333432674408	2	 And I finally dug it up and discovered Eight Legged Freaks
73449	22.81	32.23	0.3333333432674408	5	 Basically it, (stutter) the prime attraction here is that it stars that Dewey guy from, (uhh) not Scary Movie but (uhh) Scream
73449	20.036	23.76	-1.3333333730697632	4	 Independence Day and Godzilla this movie is not
73449	36.329	40.851	0.6666666865348816	7	 But the town is basically infested with giant spiders
73449	31.729	36.87	0.3333333432674408	6	 And he is I think the cop of a town again
73449	52.442	63.769	-0.6666666865348816	9	 It's like dead rising, the computer game, the video game on Xbox three-sixty with the zombies (uhh) meets (uhh) arachnids, these spiders
73449	40.449	53.143	0.0	8	 Hence the name Eight Legged Freaks and the little boy who's a little nerdy and you know, does the science fair thing, (stutter) you know, is all of a sudden the master of all these arachnids that are terrorizing the town
74101	3.144	6.509	0.0	1	 (umm) Today's product that I'm gonna review is a DVD
74101	2.306	3.635	0.0	0	Hi
74101	17.382	34.056	-2.0	3	 But this {clears throat} is the story about (umm) three girls' dreams to become singers and (uhh) it, it (stutter) won (umm) some Academy Awards I don't like this movie
74101	5.728	16.476	0.0	2	 It's called Dreamgirls starring Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, (umm) several other different famous (umm) people
74101	38.065	45.341	-1.0	5	 But (umm) just the whole story line was I I (stutter) didn't care for it
74101	34.353	38.905	0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) There's a lot of singing in it, which isn't bad, I love musicals
74101	60.923	64.008	-2.0	7	 And I I (stutter) just didn't care for the movie
74101	44.929	59.748	1.0	6	 (umm) It was about Jamie Foxx of course played sort of a bad guy who (umm), you know, used kind of used (stutter) the girls against one another to get rich and (umm) get popular
74101	63.008	69.765	-2.6666667461395264	8	 The whole plot line was (umm) just silly and stupid
74184	66.221	69.506	-1.0	11	 (umm) A little bit too much
74184	63.457	66.662	1.0	10	 {laughter} Between men and women
74184	73.474	79.543	-0.3333333432674408	13	 (umm) Even though it's (umm) PG-thirteen
74184	68.925	73.956	-1.0	12	 She uses, is a lot of foul language in this movie
74184	78.663	80.94	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I don't like it
74184	7.185	9.113	0.0	1	 It's called I Love You
74184	2.137	7.686	1.0	0	Hi (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD
74184	20.605	32.091	0.0	5	 But it's a story of a young woman (uhh) who's twenty-five who is (umm) basically in love with love and she's trying to find mister right
74184	8.113	20.916	0.0	4	 Don't Touch Me! (umm) This is a story about a young woman (umm) is probably based in the 1990s or something
74184	39.252	49.262	1.0	7	 (umm) I just watched it to find out if she happens to get together with her (umm) best friend, who is who is (stutter) a guy (umm) who's in love with her
74184	31.979	37.728	-1.3333333730697632	6	 But (umm) it's kind of a boring movie
74184	55.715	60.895	0.0	9	 And she (umm) the story focuses a lot on (umm) intimacies
74184	48.701	54.779	-0.3333333432674408	8	 But she has (umm) no feelings for him, no feelings of love for him in the beginning
74870	58.548	61.863	-0.6666666865348816	11	 And (stutter) trying to figure out what the deal is
74870	48.072	58.92	0.0	10	 And he has, he meets this girl that is kind of I don't know, taking an interest to his life a little
74870	5.429	9.841	0.0	1	 This movie is starring Wesley Snipes
74870	0.0	5.172	0.0	0	This is Blade
74870	16.823	23.221	-0.3333333432674408	3	 And he's not what you consider one of them I don't know, full vampires
74870	10.647	16.207	-0.3333333432674408	2	 It's about a man that is a vampire pretty much
74870	25.424	29.746	-0.3333333432674408	5	 Matter of fact he go around fighting actual vampires
74870	22.79	26.274	0.0	4	 Because he don't go around drinking people blood
74870	36.429	38.137	0.0	7	 Whatever they do
74870	29.744	37.179	-0.6666666865348816	6	 He is not getting his blood from sucking people's necks and all that stuff and killing folks or whatever you do
74870	45.618	48.144	-0.3333333432674408	9	 So he don't have to do all that
74870	38.095	45.56	0.0	8	 He actually gets his from a little he he (stutter) got some kind of special stuff that he use
75938	6.157	13.673	0.3333333432674408	1	 This is the third (umm) installment in the Blade series, the movie is the final one, and this is the special unrated version
75938	0.0	7.157	0.0	0	What up guys, this is Cade and I'm doing a review of the Blade Trinity
75938	17.551	25.865	-2.0	3	 So you got an extra fight scene right there, it's really long and probably just a couple of slow motion stuff going on so not exactly the best extra
75938	13.002	18.142	0.3333333432674408	2	 With the unrated version what you get is pretty much as it says on the back ten more minutes of action
75938	27.978	34.106	-0.3333333432674408	5	 It's pretty much, you know, (stutter) Wesley Snipes playing the vampire hunter Blade and it's from the Ghost Rider comic books
75938	25.563	28.978	-1.3333333730697632	4	 But yeah, also the movie itself isn't very good
75938	42.974	49.711	-1.6666666269302368	7	 This one didn't have sort of the dark feeling that the first two (umm) Blade films have, it's more just like action oriented
75938	33.775	43.405	-0.3333333432674408	6	 And he hunts for vampires and instead in this one he's joined by these people, there's more people in the team but these are the main ones that we're focused upon and they just go around killing vampires
75938	55.964	64.976	-1.3333333730697632	9	 So overall I give (umm) Blade Trinity a two because it's a little entertaining, but man, overall it's definitely not as good as the first two by any means
75938	48.711	56.485	-1.3333333730697632	8	 I felt like I was watching Triple X or something like that so it's not exactly very high on my list of action films
76124	61.232	69.915	-1.3333333730697632	10	 So, see now I didn't like this movie that much, I gave it two out of five stars, so if you like this movie it's a pretty good DVD to get because you got a lot of special features
76124	6.417	9.941	0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) This (umm) you can call it pretty much an exorcism movie
76124	0.0	6.559	-2.0	0	Hey guys, this is Tay here and I'm going to review the very unexciting movie Stigmata
76124	15.356	22.333	0.0	3	 She's a hairdresser then she, you know, like I said gets possessed and you got all these crazy satanic shenanigans going on
76124	8.941	16.356	0.0	2	 You've got (uhh) Patricia Arquette I believe, yes, and she (umm) plays this woman right here who gets a little possessed in the movie
76124	24.965	33.847	0.0	5	 You've got like the typical priest guy that's trying to help her out and so forth and he gets caught up in all this stuff, maybe even falls in love with her or something like that
76124	21.932	25.965	-1.0	4	 (umm) The plot if you ask me is kind of hollow, there's not that much going on
76124	42.405	49.451	0.0	7	 So you get like hanging from the arm and the feet and so forth and that she gets to start out with, and that's what begins the possession
76124	33.326	43.405	0.0	6	 It's this thing, you know I don't really want to go beyond that in (uhh) describing this plot of the stigmata it's just like when you get like living wounds of like the same stuff that Christ had
76124	56.254	61.943	0.0	9	 Audio commentary from the director and deleted scenes and also a music video by Natalie Imbruglia
76124	49.609	56.755	0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) This right here has got some special features including (umm) an alternate ending which is pretty interesting, we were watching that
76sN4tvbPGk	39.132	44.842	-0.6666666865348816	9	An example of a dependent clause is one that cannot stand on its own.
76sN4tvbPGk	36.02	39.803	0.3333333432674408	8	Now that's an independent clause because it can stand on its own.
76sN4tvbPGk	63.128	71.92	0.0	12	There's no complete subject, a verb and the object that gives this sentence the ability to stand on it's own.
76sN4tvbPGk	14.748	20.976	0.0	4	A subject, a verb, doesn't even have to have an object really, but that's pretty much what it is.
76sN4tvbPGk	72.686	81.049	0.3333333432674408	14	Independent, strong independent can stand on it's own, even something as simple as do it is a complete independent clause.
78577	61.172	67.211	-0.3333333432674408	11	 If you get this for five bucks, I guess it would be okay to get
78577	59.436	61.254	0.0	10	 It's widescreen, yes widescreen see
78577	70.082	74.005	-1.6666666269302368	13	 Directed by Ron Howard and he does a good job usually, but not with this
78577	67.668	70.314	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (umm) It's really not worth watching though
78577	10.078	14.351	1.3333333730697632	1	 (umm) Has a good strong supporting cast including Donald Sutherland and Robert De Niro
78577	0.49	9.362	0.3333333432674408	0	Directed by Ron Howard, Backdraft stars (uhh) Kurt Russel and William Baldwin as two Chicago Firefighters out to stop an arsonist
78577	22.5	28.19	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) For one thing it has William Baldwin, one of the worst of the Baldwin brothers
78577	13.86	22.413	-1.6666666269302368	2	 However, It's aged quite a bit and for a murder, thriller, drama starring firefighters it's not all that great of a movie
78577	37.396	43.894	2.0	5	 (umm) Starts in Chicago which is my favorite city, which gotta give props for that, that they don't use New York or Los Angeles
78577	29.814	36.541	1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) In it's some interesting use of fire, particularly the whole concept of back draft, which a lot of people don't really know about
78577	46.546	52.285	0.3333333432674408	7	 Of course it's filmed in the nineties otherwise they would've probably used New York for the firefighters
78577	43.343	47.546	-0.6666666865348816	6	 Go for something a little grittier, get the (uhh) audience
78577	57.78	60.436	-0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) just captions and subtitles
78577	53.879	57.962	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) The movie has very few (uhh) additional features on it
78Ncka6CY70	0.012	17.612	1.3333333730697632	0	"You are looking at Absorb Health's DIM or Di-indolyl-methane Described on the official Dr. Oz blog as a ""superantioxidant to help prevent chronic diseases"", DIM is a cruciferous vegetable extract that promotes healthy hormonal balance by lessening the effects of excess estrogen."
79644	5.369	12.904	0.0	1	 It stars Bill Murray and (uhh) it runs for an hour and forty-two minutes and it's rated R
79644	0.0	5.771	0.0	0	I'm here to talk about this movie (uhh) Lost in Translation
79644	18.479	26.084	-1.6666666269302368	3	 It was really slow, it was boring, (uhh) the story line didn't make any sense at all
79644	12.852	19.479	-2.0	2	 This has (uhh) been out for a little while and (umm) I didn't really like this movie
79644	49.05	60.975	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) I don't I don't (stutter) know, you might like this, you might not, but I just didn't really think, you know, I don't think it was up to Bill Murray's standards but (umm) try it, you might think differently
79644	25.663	46.278	-1.3333333730697632	4	 It's about some (uhh) TV personality, I guess that's what he was, that (uhh) went to Japan for to to (stutter) do some promotions and (umm) things he did there, the girl he met and all this kind of thing but I just really didn't enjoy this and I I (stutter) just didn't understand what the story was about and this {sigh}
79934	-0.488	11.617	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi this is a movie that stars Kurt Russell and it's called Dark Blue, and (uhh) (umm) Kurt Russell kind of played, he plays a L
79934	15.476	23.989	0.0	3	 And (umm) he has a new (uhh) rookie that goes with him and (umm) he sort of teaches him the ropes
79934	11.036	15.578	0.0	2	 police (uhh) guy and (uhh) he's a mean guy
79934	31.699	37.109	0.3333333432674408	5	 And (umm) but he's kind of showing the other guy the ropes, so
79934	22.989	32.161	-0.6666666865348816	4	 But in this movie, (umm) Kurt Russell he plays a kind of a bad character the cop is kind of mean
79934	50.716	63.868	-2.3333332538604736	7	 And so there's a twist kind of a twist (stutter) at the end but I didn't care for it, I didn't like Kurt Russell in this role, and I didn't like the movie story and (uhh) so I, I (stutter) can't recommend this movie
79934	36.638	50.988	-1.3333333730697632	6	 I I (stutter) didn't care for the movie because of the, I didn't like the storyline, and (uhh) at the end I think (uhh) you know it (stutter) at, the Rodney King (uhh) riot breaks out in the movie
79935	84.22	93.252	0.3333333432674408	11	 But (stutters) Katherine was the only (umm) actress in there that did a credible job of acting
79935	78.583	84.571	-1.3333333730697632	10	 Had they put out the bad language shot, I don't think as many people would go to see the movie
79935	95.574	98.101	-2.0	13	 (uhh) They just weren't good actors
79935	92.252	95.457	-2.6666667461395264	12	 All of the other actors were terrible
79935	100.752	102.91	-1.6666666269302368	15	 I wouldn't recommend it
79935	97.121	101.463	-2.6666667461395264	14	 The script was bad and it's just totally a gross movie
79935	107.517	110.672	0.3333333432674408	17	 In fact (uhh) I would give it an award
79935	104.813	107.809	-2.6666667461395264	16	 (uhh) (uhh) Wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody
79935	115.519	118.594	-1.3333333730697632	19	 (uhh) So again, the movie is Knocked Up
79935	109.672	115.431	-2.3333332538604736	18	 It was, this is the worse movie in ten years award is what I would give the movie
79935	18.35	25.815	-2.6666667461395264	1	 I wanted to go back to the manager and ask for my money back (uhh) cause this movie is really bad
79935	0.0	19.35	-2.3333332538604736	0	Hi, I'm gonna review a movie in theaters now and this movie's called Knocked Up and it stars Katherine Heigl and some other (uhh) cast members and I was really disappointed with the with the (stutter) movie and felt you know, I got short changed
79935	41.038	47.595	-3.0	3	 (uhh) (uhh) shots about drugs or scenes with drugs in it and the language in it was horrible
79935	24.945	38.646	-2.0	2	 Now it is rated R for sexual content and language and drugs and it had all three of those and the drugs it had too much and just totally unnecessary
79935	48.292	51.367	-2.0	5	 (uhh) Really gross language
79935	46.685	48.603	-2.0	4	 It was bad
79935	55.116	60.656	-2.3333332538604736	7	 In fact I wouldn't wouldn't (stutter) recommend the movie to anybody unless you're over a hundred
79935	51.045	55.428	-1.3333333730697632	6	 So you definitely don't wanna take your children to this movie
79935	65.223	79.583	-2.6666667461395264	9	 But I was totally (uhh) totally (uhh) turned off by the movie and you notice that, or we notice that in the trailers that they put out on the movie, you know they only showed the funny shots
79935	60.703	65.285	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (uhh) Even then (uhh) It's probably not a good movie to watch
7CLe7PZtna4	55.844	60.815	0.6666666865348816	8	And so there are challenges, and as a measurement company we’re trying to meet those challenges.
7CLe7PZtna4	47.823	51.886	-0.3333333432674408	6	A lot of clients aren’t comfortable with that or their management is comfortable with that.

7ZzbemE4QEE	59.536	71.072	-0.3333333432674408	12	 The buyer sees that as a sign of weakness, and they jump on that and they try to negotiate, and you lose money, most likely more money than it would have taken to replace the item
7ZzbemE4QEE	79.78	83.753	0.3333333432674408	15	 The put in too much money, and they wind up losing in the end

7rMLN0KKE5k	181.01	187.537	-1.3333333730697632	30	 We may not be able to change the results of the election now, but we can make sure that our books create empathy

80914	19.327	34.715	1.6666666269302368	2	 David Foley was also the voice in the Pixar film A Bug's Life which is one of my favorite films, but unfortunately some people don't view it as the best, one of the best (stutter) better Pixar films, but {snort} what do they know? Anyways this is (uhh) it's a comedy
80914	39.422	41.868	-1.0	5	 I give it two out five stars
80914	37.317	40.422	1.0	4	 (uhh) It has some funny jokes in it that are alright
80914	46.685	50.06	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) David Foley is pretty funny, the rest of the cast kind of (uhh)
80914	40.868	45.75	0.3333333432674408	6	 If you see it on like (uhh) (umm) TV or something like that I'd say watch it
80914	49.928	63.679	-2.0	8	 Otherwise two out of five stars as I said before and (uhh) he's accused of a murder, well he thinks he's accused of a murder that he didn't commit and it's basically him as a fugitive running away from people that aren't trying to chase him, although he does find the real killer
81406	8.821	14.86	-1.0	1	 (uhh) He however did get started making (uhh) oh, rather bad films
81406	0.58	9.243	1.0	0	Keanu Reeves has risen to be one of the (uhh) most popular (uhh) action stars of pretty much in the last, probably a decade
81406	17.222	32.36	0.3333333432674408	3	 {hmm}, Point Break he plays this, a young FBI agent that (uhh) pretty much goes on (uhh) or starts with a company and has a partner, Gary Busey, who is a little bit more (uhh) experienced
81406	14.369	17.673	-2.3333332538604736	2	 Point Break is one of his worst
81406	38.205	46.668	0.0	5	 He meets up with (uhh) Patrick Swayze, which (stutter) the is known as the world's most shirtless man
81406	31.749	39.085	0.6666666865348816	4	 He gives undercover and becomes a surfer and someone who's generally addicted to extreme sports
81406	65.672	72.878	-2.0	7	 (umm) There's also skydiving, (umm) bad acting, and in general just mayhem
81406	47.593	65.335	0.0	6	 (umm) They (uhh) work together yeah, to uncover, Busey and Keanu Reeves work together to uncover (uhh) a string of bank robberies that are portrayed (uhh) (stutter) that are done by the (uhh) surfer gang that Keanu Reeves joins
81538	70.461	75.712	-1.0	11	 Really, really weakling in this movie, okay, alright, that's my review
81538	54.817	71.461	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (stutter) If you wanna see a movie that takes before Hannibal I recommend it but if you like the Hannibal movies and you don't wanna ruin it, don't see this movie cuz it will probably ruin it and (uhh) you probably won't like Hannibal anymore cuz he's I don't know
81538	4.751	8.105	0.0	1	 Now this is a blockbuster exclusive I guess
81538	0.61	5.292	0.0	0	Curtis here with the new (uhh) the new Hannibal movie, Hannibal Rising
81538	10.218	13.762	0.0	3	 (uhh) So {cough} you can find it at any Blockbuster
81538	7.424	10.42	0.0	2	 Apparently a straight to DVD rental
81538	17.781	26.663	-1.3333333730697632	5	 But it was really really like (stutter) timid and (uhh) pretty, pretty (uhh) pretty low, I don't know low budget but not really I don't know
81538	13.221	18.232	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (uhh) I was expecting something a little more gory, maybe a little more horror-ish
81538	38.005	49.172	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (uhh) I wouldn't really recommended it if, recommend it (stutter) if you wanna like watch a Hannibal movie I'd recommend just going to see like Silence of the Lambs or (uhh) Hannibal, the other Hannibal movies
81538	26.082	38.027	-1.3333333730697632	6	 Hannibal (uhh) Hannibal Lecter wasn't really, he was played as a character that was like a teenager and he, he (stutter) was kind of like progressing into his cannibalistic stage of the other movies
81538	51.375	54.709	-1.3333333730697632	9	 But (uhh) I don't know I'd recommend it if you want
81538	48.441	52.005	-1.3333333730697632	8	 Which are okay, they're not, they're not (stutter) that great either
81615	0.879	7.856	0.0	1	 This movie (umm) review is about the two-thousand seven movie called Allegro
81615	0.0	0.941	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
81615	18.499	25.166	1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) The piano playing in the film music were pretty much exciting (umm) and excellent
81615	8.103	17.813	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) It's basically kind of confusing movie and if I had to give it a grade, it would probably be like (uhh) a scale on one to ten it would probably be a five or a six
81615	30.722	48.703	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (umm) It was just hard to go along with the whole movie because (umm) because of the fantasy portion it was it was (stutter) related to the zone and (uhh) basically some people like me cannot follow it, and it was just kind of boring and confusing
81615	25.463	29.407	-1.0	4	 (umm) This story is really complicated to follow
81615	64.774	67.49	-1.0	7	 It's really not a great movie
81615	47.783	65.774	-1.0	6	 (umm) I don't know it was basically not a movie from mainstream and (uhh) basically it was just kind of a really confusing and boring movie like I said and it's not worth paying your money for in my opinion if it's even out in your theaters
81668	3.304	6.09	0.0	1	 And it's called Sixteen Candles
81668	0.361	4.304	0.0	0	I'm here to review this dvd
81668	17.651	22.383	-2.3333332538604736	3	 (uhh) I was very disappointed in this because it's rated PG
81668	5.768	17.474	-0.3333333432674408	2	 It stars Molly Ringwald, and (uhh) it's been out for, for quite awhile, so (uhh), you know you may have to look a little harder to find it if you want to see this
81668	29.055	37.129	-2.0	5	 And (uhh) I would be really, really careful in watching your kids, (uhh) letting your kids see this because it's not appropriate
81668	21.383	29.576	-2.3333332538604736	4	 Now that has to be a typo, because there's (uhh) a lot of bad language, and there's nudity in this movie
81668	42.994	65.914	-2.3333332538604736	7	 It (uhh) I believe it's even been on tv but I'm sure they had to delete those scenes but if you watch this movie, those things are in there and (uhh) for little kids, this movie is deceptive because it looks like it's, you know, it's for (uhh) teenagers or whatever, but (umm) I I (stutter) just was greatly disappointed in this, but (uhh) I don't, I don't (stutter) (uhh) suggest you watch this at all
81668	36.718	43.994	-2.0	6	 And it's, that's my recommendation this this (stutter) is not appropriate for for (stutter) young kids to see
81668	64.914	75.542	-2.3333332538604736	8	 I mean if you want to check it out if you're curious after what I said, that's that's (stutter) up to you but (uhh) I don't understand why it says PG on the back when all that stuff is in there, so
83310	6.696	22.822	-0.6666666865348816	1	 Kickin' It Old School is (uhh) movie about a kid who is very interested in break dancing and (uhh) given in his childhood days he gets into an accident and while break dancing itself and he goes into a coma for twenty years
83310	0.61	7.068	0.0	0	Hi my name is xxx and today I will xxx the movie for you Kickin' It Old School which is going to be playing in theaters
83310	22.46	93.282	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) He wakes up twenty years later and (uhh) he finds out that he's still kid but with that and also he xxx that dream of making it big in breaking dance in the break dance industry so he regroups his friends and they enter a competition (umm) and (umm) the movie goes on from there there is also this girl who is who is so interested in him (uhh) (umm) same thing I mean (uhh) the rivals from his childhood is again the same rival and (uhh) the whole movie is about how he win the xxx and how he wins the whole competition so the I mean the plot plot (stutter) sounds just okay but the movie is utterly disappointing I mean I did not really enjoy the movie a lot basically because of (umm) the fact that you know xxx that the guy as a kid and (uhh) I mean none of the guys did an exceptional jobs so ended up very disappointed with the movie I do not recommend you watch the trailers I don't even recommend you watch it because (uhh) I actually just rated (umm) two out of five so that's all
83859	75.659	78.346	0.0	24	 There (stutter) are shooting locations
83859	77.346	81.788	0.6666666865348816	25	 It talks about the script, how it was developed, how it became Heat
83859	81.147	84.801	0.3333333432674408	26	 And basically, it actually has Al Pacino and De Niro
83859	84.0	86.996	0.6666666865348816	27	 There's a famous scene where they meet in the coffee shop
83859	67.727	71.292	1.3333333730697632	20	 And you get a lot of special features on the movie
83859	70.521	75.133	1.0	21	 You have eleven additional scenes, five new making documentaries
83859	74.342	76.43	0.3333333432674408	22	 (uhh) They were, they go back to L
83859	86.235	94.249	0.3333333432674408	28	 A lot of rumors swirling around the Internet that Pacino and De Niro were there on different days, they were not actually there filming at the same time
83859	93.439	96.335	0.0	29	 But, believe it or not, that rumor is actually dispelled
83859	4.381	14.082	2.6666667461395264	1	 It is a Michael Mann film, and it has two of the greatest actors of all time playing on the (uhh) same movie: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro
83859	-0.488	5.112	2.0	0	Hey ExpoTV, how are you doing today? I'm going to review one of my favorite movies of all time, this is Heat
83859	17.102	23.171	2.6666667461395264	3	 I believe it's one of the best, if not the best, cops-and-robbers good guy-bad buy film of all time
83859	13.082	18.102	0.3333333432674408	2	 This is your average cops-and-robbers film, but it's not so average
83859	27.888	32.719	2.3333332538604736	5	 And it is a great movie, a little long, three hours, but it definitely packs a punch
83859	22.171	28.609	0.0	4	 Al Pacino plays a detective and Robert De Niro plays the (uhh) bad guy who is doing all these heists
83859	33.266	37.818	1.6666666269302368	7	 You have Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman
83859	32.009	34.266	2.6666667461395264	6	 Supporting cast is great
83859	39.821	44.902	0.3333333432674408	9	 You all know him from the Allstate commercials and for being the ex-president on twenty four
83859	37.007	40.821	0.0	8	 Dennis Haysbert makes a small role in here
83859	114.501	116.708	2.6666667461395264	38	 Definitely a great movie
83859	46.665	49.431	2.6666667461395264	11	 Definitely watch this movie multiple times
83859	44.071	47.665	3.0	10	 Overall, I would give this movie a five out of five
83859	52.592	55.468	0.0	13	 We were supposed to watch Bridge on the River Kwai
83859	48.611	53.342	0.0	12	 I was first brought to this movie when I was at film camp from North Carolina School of the Arts
83859	56.313	57.862	1.0	15	 I'm glad he did
83859	54.468	57.074	0.0	14	 Our TA instead let us show Heat
83859	59.027	62.581	1.0	17	 And this right here is the two-disc special edition
83859	56.862	59.888	3.0	16	 This is one of my all-time favorite movies
83859	64.814	68.727	0.0	19	 ten years after the movie was released in theaters
83859	62.13	65.814	0.0	18	 It came out about two years ago in two thousand five
83859	101.331	103.508	2.3333332538604736	31	 Definitely a great film
83859	95.335	102.052	1.0	30	 They were, believe it or not, Pacino and De Niro, rivals, together in one scene at the same time
83859	111.947	115.501	0.3333333432674408	37	 {noise} Where's the van? {noise} you know in his comedy thing
83859	109.373	112.947	0.6666666865348816	36	 I'm sure you all remember Dane Cook talking about this
83859	108.265	110.373	2.6666667461395264	35	 Great heist scene
83859	106.898	109.036	2.6666667461395264	34	 Great action film
83859	104.843	107.898	2.0	33	 A lot for the guys, definitely want to pick this up
83859	102.508	105.673	3.0	32	 If you have not seen this, I highly recommend this
83_N43pvgHI	93.17	100.914	1.0	11	That enthusiasm and that passion for that subject that you love will help you be more conversational.
83_N43pvgHI	43.812	53.761	-0.3333333432674408	5	If you're not excited about it, if you could care less about it, that enthusiasm, that passion, will not exist.
8404	44.54	50.888	2.0	11	 I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies who doesn't mind seeing a little blood and gore and things like that
8404	43.123	45.47	2.0	10	 Everything in this movie is great
8404	54.976	57.363	0.6666666865348816	13	 So (umm) yep
8404	50.257	55.597	2.3333332538604736	12	 But (umm) it has a great story, it even has a little bit of a love story for you know, the ladies
8404	8.253	15.419	-0.3333333432674408	1	 Now this movie came out (uhh) a while back and before I saw it I really thought it was just gonna be a straight gore (uhh) flick
8404	3.354	8.963	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm gonna be reviewing the movie the DVD, Gladiator
8404	19.786	23.351	2.6666667461395264	3	 Well it turns out this movie's actually really really good
8404	14.419	20.786	0.3333333432674408	2	 I thought it was just gonna have lots of (umm) lots of blood, lots of violence and that's all it was gonna be about
8404	26.212	28.688	3.0	5	 I enjoyed every bit of it
8404	22.351	27.212	3.0	4	 It has a great storyline, the actors were great, there was nothing bad about this movie
8404	32.398	35.473	1.3333333730697632	7	 It has (umm) lots of action sequences in it
8404	28.147	33.398	2.0	6	 Sometimes it can be a little bit long, but (umm) it really was a great movie
8404	38.524	44.004	2.3333332538604736	9	 So (umm) Ridley Scott (umm) directed this movie and he did a great job
8404	34.722	39.145	2.0	8	 It does have a lot of blood and gore and stuff but it also has a great storyline
84133	87.453	91.915	2.3333332538604736	20	 (umm) Michael Clark Duncan is in here and we all know he's stone cold cool
84133	91.244	93.92	0.6666666865348816	21	 And so is Colin Farrell
84133	93.11	95.407	1.3333333730697632	22	 And like, I like Colin Farrell
84133	94.736	101.633	-2.0	23	 But this movie's just not good and I highly suspect that it's because of the Ben Affleck
84133	5.469	11.258	3.0	1	 (umm) I love everything about them, the cheese factor, the action sequences, the whole thing
84133	0.0	5.96	1.6666666269302368	0	Hey expo tv I'm Dea and as a rule I love superhero movies, I've said that before
84133	15.327	17.175	1.0	3	 As to all rules
84133	10.917	16.117	0.0	2	 However there are there are (stutter) some of, some exceptions to that rule
84133	20.624	27.751	-2.3333332538604736	5	 This is very likely one of the worst {laugh} movies of all time
84133	16.873	21.036	1.0	4	 (umm) One of the exceptions to my rule is Daredevil
84133	31.819	36.531	-2.6666667461395264	7	 But Ben Affleck is seriously a black hole of talent
84133	27.569	32.41	-2.0	6	 Okay, I'm not saying this out of hatred or to be stylish
84133	42.315	43.954	0.0	9	 It's true
84133	35.76	43.315	-1.3333333730697632	8	 Because no matter how many awesome people you put in a movie, Ben Affleck can suck any good out of it
84133	46.326	50.639	-1.3333333730697632	11	 And I don't personally, I don't have like a vendetta against him, I don't hate him or anything
84133	43.223	47.117	0.0	10	 There are a couple movies that Ben Affleck is in that I I (stutter) actually like
84133	52.981	55.188	0.0	13	 There are a couple of those people
84133	49.938	53.981	0.0	12	 I, he's not one of those people like, if he's in a movie I refuse to watch it
84133	60.504	64.158	0.0	15	 Anytime like post the nineties at least
84133	55.046	61.254	-1.3333333730697632	14	 But it just seems like anytime Ben Affleck's in a movie, it's just bad
84133	66.76	72.888	-0.6666666865348816	17	 Jennifer Garner plays Elektra Nacho, or as we like to call her, electric nachos
84133	64.225	67.281	1.6666666269302368	16	 (umm) I mean a ton of really cool people are in here
84133	85.158	86.916	-1.6666666269302368	19	 It's sad
84133	72.886	86.078	-1.6666666269302368	18	 (umm) She, as cool as Jennifer Garner is, and as hot as she looks in all this leather, she still cannot fight the sucktasticism that is Ben Affleck
84176	64.385	71.531	-0.3333333432674408	10	 So as a person who like, you know I know a lot of people who are like, I don't, I don't (stutter) dig the superhero movies, they're too corny for me
84176	7.863	12.495	1.6666666269302368	1	 And I just like the cheese factor, the cheesier the better
84176	0.0	8.365	2.0	0	Hey ExpoTV I'm Dea and something that I've mentioned so many times in so many different videos is that I love superhero movies
84176	14.548	24.408	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) And I've also mentioned that I do very few negative reviews, alas this is one of those and what's even worse is that it is about a superhero movie
84176	11.675	14.521	3.0	2	 That's how much I love them I'm like a big fan
84176	27.748	30.594	0.3333333432674408	5	 Okay, here's something that I have to tell you
84176	24.366	27.561	0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) This right here is Hulk
84176	41.956	48.962	1.3333333730697632	7	 If I'm watching a movie I'll stick it out until the end because you know, I want to see what happens maybe it redeems itself
84176	30.053	42.956	-1.0	6	 I will usually stick it out no matter what like, if I'm reading a book that I don't care for, I'll finish reading it anyway just to get to the end and you know have an actual educated view of it
84176	60.135	64.956	-2.3333332538604736	9	 I mean like, like Shazam with Shaquille O'Neal awful
84176	48.391	60.845	-3.0	8	 This movie was so bad that I couldn't you know, I tried watching it to the end and I was like this is awful on a level that I have previously not experienced in my existence
856LGms_0s0	64.794	73.157	0.6666666865348816	9	So I'm confident that as long as CEO's keep this on the agenda, we won't lose out during this current crisis.
856LGms_0s0	51.145	65.704	1.6666666269302368	8	I think these are cost saving methods that will help us in our business, but I also think people are too aware at this point in time of the danger the climate is in to take a back burner.

87161	79.161	84.262	-0.3333333432674408	11	 (uhh) A special mention about (uhh) Ethan Ambrey's acting in the movie
87161	75.081	79.353	-2.0	10	 So it's a very boring movie I would just rate it one out of five
87161	86.405	99.298	-1.6666666269302368	13	 (uhh) I mean I don't know what other kind of expressions he's given but he looks at I mean, many times he just looks like he's having (uhh) stomach problems so his acting is just horrible
87161	83.651	85.609	-2.6666667461395264	12	 It is horrible
87161	98.897	109.854	1.3333333730697632	14	 But from that Jennifer Love Hewitt is the main reason I got the DVD to watch and (uhh) she's looking cute and (uhh) she's looking pretty good, so
87161	7.225	25.965	0.0	1	 (umm) Can't Hardly Wait is a movie which starts out as a, in a, in a (stutter) high school graduation ceremony kind of a setting and (uhh) it starts out as everybody is discussing in the, in the (stutter) (uhh) ceremony that (uhh) Amanda was (uhh) dumped by a man named Mike Dexter
87161	0.331	5.92	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi my name is Nalin and today I will be reviewing for you the movie Can't Hardly Wait
87161	31.949	41.36	0.0	3	 And (uhh) they were like the hot couple of the high school for four years and (uhh) that's where the whole hype about their breakup
87161	25.424	32.49	0.0	2	 So Amanda is actually the homecoming queen and (uhh) Mike Dexter is the homecoming king
87161	48.521	50.998	0.0	5	 (uhh) Who is the prom queen
87161	40.809	48.444	-0.6666666865348816	4	 So then it starts out that the guy, there's a guy who likes (uhh) the girl Amanda
87161	60.135	67.49	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (uhh) The movie on the whole is very average, I mean (uhh) there were very, very boring parts in the whole movie
87161	50.457	60.396	0.0	6	 So that guy other prom queen Amanda is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt and (uhh) the other guy who likes her a lot is played by Ethan Ambrey
87161	69.823	76.081	-2.3333332538604736	9	 (uhh) Not too much humor, very predictable and you can actually just figure out what's gonna happen in the end
87161	67.039	69.476	-1.3333333730697632	8	 Not very exciting stuff
87400	69.753	71.94	0.0	11	 But it is
87400	65.852	70.174	-1.3333333730697632	10	 So don't write off the entire series just because this one movie is bad
87400	73.704	75.462	2.6666667461395264	13	 It's amazing
87400	71.409	74.614	1.6666666269302368	12	 If you haven't seen Ocean's Eleven, go see it
87400	78.802	83.374	-1.3333333730697632	15	 So, I would give this movie, a two out of five
87400	75.49	79.513	-0.3333333432674408	14	 Skip Ocean's Twelve, go see Ocean's Thirteen
87400	90.546	94.259	1.0	17	 Yeah alright, well, have a good night
87400	82.374	89.79	-1.3333333730697632	16	 It was just it was just weak and it was not something that I really liked that much
87400	7.405	26.473	-0.3333333432674408	1	 Now I loved Ocean's Eleven, it was just a great movie and it had all these great actors in it and it was just a lot of fun, but Ocean's Twelve seems like it was really stretching to you know, find a plot to find some action, just all around to find some entertainment
87400	0.0	7.806	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi, I'm back and I'm going to be giving a review of a movie I did not like, Ocean's Twelve
87400	27.319	33.158	1.0	3	 I mean it's got George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt all those people
87400	26.092	28.319	-1.6666666269302368	2	 I just wouldn't recommend it
87400	35.64	39.434	-1.0	5	 I mean, they they're (stutter) good actors, it's just a boring movie
87400	33.106	36.331	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (umm) But none of em were just very good in this movie
87400	46.785	58.281	-2.3333332538604736	7	 Yeah they're in, it's been awhile since I've seen it, they are in Europe and looking to find a safe and it just, you know I honestly don't even remember that much but I was just falling asleep during the movie, it just wasn't good
87400	38.853	47.785	0.0	6	 Now the plot of this movie is that they (umm) are actually I believe in Europe
87400	63.667	66.572	2.6666667461395264	9	 I just saw that and that's a fantastic movie
87400	57.73	64.667	1.3333333730697632	8	 Now they seem to have (uhh) redeemed themselves in Ocean's Thirteen, which is actually out in theaters right now
87MsiC3E2-w	0.0	5.86	0.0	0	Well, that-- it may be readjusting how the-- what their marketing message is.
88119	9.59	24.827	0.0	1	 It's a story about when the CIA basically came into effect and how it came into effect and some of the major events that led to this, mostly dealing with the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War
88119	0.72	9.532	0.3333333432674408	0	This is Dustin and today I'm reviewing The Good Shepherd, with Robert De Niro, Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie
88119	58.129	61.175	-1.3333333730697632	3	 Overall this movie wasn't very good
88119	25.454	58.69	0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) Basically in this movie Matt Damon is a CIA agent and it goes through the effects that it has on his life of how secretive it is and everything and (umm) having to keep the secrets even from his family and how this ruins his family life basically and (umm) about how the US government is corrupt (uhh) in a way and and (stutter) (uhh) interfere with other country's affairs and everything
88119	61.541	66.473	-1.0	5	I mean it had a story but it was very (uhh) drawn out
88119	60.175	62.541	-1.6666666269302368	4	 It lacked action
88119	65.473	68.538	1.0	6	 The movie is two hours and forty minutes
88245	9.989	25.226	-0.3333333432674408	1	 And basically it's just (umm) the two of them are husband and wife and the story's just about (umm) him losing his job and they go to live with her parents and then he works for her dad
88245	0.0	10.41	0.6666666865348816	0	The movie I'm reviewing is The Ex, and it's in movie theaters now and it stars (umm) Zach Braff and Amanda Peet
88245	33.635	38.975	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) But it's supposed to be a comedy and it really wasn't all that funny
88245	24.366	33.408	0.0	2	 And (umm) The one guy that he works with was involved with Amanda Peet (umm) before, and so he's the ex
88245	47.982	56.226	-2.0	5	 But (umm) it just like I said it wasn't really too funny and the story line wasn't really all that great either
88245	39.432	48.982	-2.0	4	 (umm) I had somebody when I watched the movie (umm) near us who was just laughing obnoxiously at everything so that also kind of made it a little weird
88245	63.367	69.685	-2.0	7	 And I probably wouldn't recommend (uhh) renting it either when it comes out on DVD so
88245	55.226	64.367	-1.0	6	 so (umm) if you're looking to just go see any kind of movie, (umm) you could go see it but it's not one I would really recommend
88797	64.185	66.313	-1.0	11	 I don't think it's possible
88797	61.382	63.739	-0.6666666865348816	10	 I'm not ruining anything for you
88797	67.019	69.785	-2.3333332538604736	13	 So, I'd probably give it a, one out of five
88797	65.742	67.76	-0.3333333432674408	12	 The movie ruins it for itself
88797	3.114	11.966	-2.0	1	 This movie was pretty predictable, and, not that entertaining
88797	0.42	2.598	0.0	0	Here we have Stealth
88797	14.079	17.504	0.0	3	 (umm) Josh Lucas, Jessica Beil, and Jamie Foxx
88797	11.026	14.431	0.0	2	 I mean, it has all the big names in it that you've heard before
88797	22.969	25.466	1.3333333730697632	5	 I (stutter) without a better word good
88797	16.773	23.899	-2.3333332538604736	4	 However, I don't know, it just lacked a lot of good, in the movie
88797	32.188	40.671	0.0	7	 (umm) The whole premise of this movie is that (umm), the government has made an AI plane, which that means (stutter) artificial intelligence
88797	24.905	32.151	-1.0	6	 (umm), I don't know if it was the screenplay or what, but this movie just wasn't very memorable and not very captivating
88797	55.126	62.362	0.3333333432674408	9	 So, from that point, I'll let you decide, but that's just on the back, the back (stutter) of the thing
88797	39.921	55.697	0.0	8	 That (uhh), plane is very smart, and learns, and it put it together with this three man team, the three characters on the front to go on missions and then as the premise of the movie begins, it goes haywire
88888	54.049	59.109	-1.0	10	 But if you like kind of dumbed down action movies then this is for you
88888	5.948	8.474	-2.6666667461395264	1	 (uhh) Honestly I thought this movie sucked
88888	0.091	5.381	0.3333333432674408	0	Today we're gonna check out Mission: Impossible two, starring Tom Cruise
88888	14.967	23.061	1.6666666269302368	3	 It was interesting and it wasn't just there (uhh) to to (stutter) throw in as much action as possible
88888	8.203	15.967	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (uhh) Mission Impossible one, I thought was much better (uhh) because it was actually (uhh) it had a good plot
88888	24.506	48.224	-2.6666667461395264	5	 This one (uhh) is to me, pretty much ridiculous and it seems as though, they were just trying to make it as extreme as possible and that is definitely the truth in one scene where (uhh) Tom Cruise (uhh) is riding through some flames on his motorcycle doing a nose wheelie and stuff like that
88888	22.061	24.967	1.6666666269302368	4	 It was a a (stutter) true spy movie
88888	48.651	50.21	0.0	7	 Look at that
88888	47.224	49.351	0.3333333432674408	6	 I mean just look at the cover
88888	51.863	54.649	-1.3333333730697632	9	 It's a little too extreme for my taste
88888	50.606	52.863	0.3333333432674408	8	 That's how extreme this is
88S1BjwMfdw	6.566	14.331	0.6666666865348816	3	Now return on equity or return on stockholders equity is one of the most important financial matters to consider.

88oSn21TFcA	55.006	69.117	-1.0	8	Without the ability to pre-screen thousands and thousands of refugee claimants, governments, I believe, put their citizens at risk in admitting these refugees.
89747	6.926	12.655	2.6666667461395264	1	 (uhh) This is probably one of my favorite movies and definitely my favorite comedy, you know, that I own

89747	66.011	73.367	2.6666667461395264	5	 I mean honestly, it's just a really, really well made movie, it's definitely (uhh) Bill Murray, you know, at one of his best and most comical roles
89747	54.797	66.522	1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) You know throughout he, you know the love interest, Andie MacDowell, falls in love (stutter) continually tries, you know, to get into the bed, you know, although he only has an actual day to do it because he keeps starting over

89787	23.498	27.81	-1.3333333730697632	6	 But this one just was badly paced

9-K1CXCXui4	105.801	128.741	1.0	10	 And there will be some key stats in there, there will be stats like how long they were on your site, how many pages did these visitors typically visit, and what's the bounce rate, typically, for these visitors from the BBB? Now, the bounce rate, for those of you who don't know, without getting too much into the details, is people who come to your site, visit one page, and then, they're out of there
9-K1CXCXui4	134.875	151.08	0.3333333432674408	13	 Anyway, so if you want to determine if your advertising dollars are being well spent on the Better Business Bureau, or any other website like that, you simply go to that referrals area, that will help you determine if that 50% of your ad dollars should go to them, or another resource
9-K1CXCXui4	133.278	135.346	-0.3333333432674408	12	 Lower numbers are better

9-K1CXCXui4	150.449	159.082	1.3333333730697632	14	 The same tactic works for other directories, maybe, if you're in the Woodlands area, the Woodlands Online is pretty popular here, if you're in Katy, coveringkaty

9-K1CXCXui4	27.918	34.306	1.0	3	 And he grew that into 16 stores, and those stores were eventually integrated into Macy's
9-K1CXCXui4	19.178	28.918	0.6666666865348816	2	""" The question is, which half? Now, John went on to found one of the first successful department stores"
9-K1CXCXui4	41.198	54.49	0.6666666865348816	5	 There are a lot of different options out there for advertising, and the Better Business Bureau is probably a good option as any, I'm a big fan of the BBB, and they also have a local directory section there
9-K1CXCXui4	33.306	41.789	0.3333333432674408	4	 And like, department stores, one of the easier ways to get traffic to visit your website, is to advertise
9-K1CXCXui4	59.466	74.814	0.0	7	 Now, the question is, those visitors, we're on the Better Business Bureau website, in that local directory area, do they go from there to your site? And you can find that out by looking at Google Analytics
9-K1CXCXui4	53.789	60.127	0.3333333432674408	6	 You can find plumbers, you can find electricians, and yes, you can even find web designers
9-K1CXCXui4	100.463	106.801	0.6666666865348816	9	 And so, if they're doing you some good, if they're sending visitors your way, you'll see an entry in there from the BBB
9-K1CXCXui4	74.223	101.154	1.3333333730697632	8	 There's a section there called referrals, so if you dig around in there, you can find the referrals section, by the way, if you're having trouble finding that referral section, just add a comment below, I'll be happy to tell you the exact method to get there, the exact steps to get there, but if you look at that referrals area, you can find entries, and you can find entries from all different websites visiting you, it might be Facebook, it might be Twitter, and in there, you should find an entry for the BBB
90172	94.038	108.886	-1.3333333730697632	11	 Doesn't actually have a commentary track but it has what it calls a conversation with the director, which is basically you know, a pretty short short interview that doesn't really, you know, say that much about the direction because honestly there there wasn't really much that focus on the direction in the first place you know
90172	89.009	94.678	0.3333333432674408	10	 It has a documentary on the special effects, you know the trailers
90172	111.727	120.36	-0.6666666865348816	13	 (uhh) But you know, like I said, if you like action movies you know, pretty B rated action movies or if you're a big fan of dragons, maybe it's worth seeing
90172	107.886	111.899	-0.6666666865348816	12	 It's about pretty pretty average, like in general
90172	119.39	122.216	-1.6666666269302368	14	 Otherwise it's it's (stutter) pretty forgettable
90172	11.665	15.598	-0.3333333432674408	1	 I don't rate this movie very highly
90172	0.39	12.036	-1.6666666269302368	0	I'll be reviewing the (umm) DVD version of Reign of Fire, starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, with Christian Bale giving probably the worst performance of his career as far as I'm concerned
90172	19.926	39.654	0.0	3	 (uhh) If you don't know what it's about (uhh) it's kind of the excavation of a new tunnel in (uhh) in England uncovers an egg of a dragon which hatches and manages to breed by itself creating a world of, of dragons and basically annihilates most of (uhh) human society as they burn scorch the earth and you know and feed on the ash kind of thing
90172	14.598	19.958	-2.3333332538604736	2	 I think it's pretty hokey and pretty much a pretty forgettable throwaway (uhh) action movie
90172	46.336	57.234	0.3333333432674408	5	 Matthew McConaughey plays a American group of survivors kind of show up and the two of em basically have kind of a dominance leadership fight, while trying to fight the dragons
90172	38.654	47.336	0.6666666865348816	4	 But there's you know, a rag tag groups of survivors you know, trying to fight the (stutters) the dragons and survive and (uhh) Christian Bale plays one of the survivors
90172	74.751	77.657	-2.3333332538604736	7	 It's just overall not a great movie
90172	56.234	75.253	0.0	6	 You know this movie is basically (stutter) designed simply around having, trying to have cool action sequences between modern jet fighters and (uhh) and ancient you know medieval era dragons and unfortunately a lot of the plot and character gets lost, you know ii that emphasis
90172	84.06	90.009	1.0	9	 The special feature includes, what you'd usually see in you know, a mid level type DVD like this, you know
90172	76.657	84.422	-0.3333333432674408	8	 You know it's really good if you're just looking for something different or you're a huge fan of dragons, but otherwise it's honestly pretty forget (stutter) forgettable

91276	26.282	30.025	-2.0	4	 The story line in this film falls flat
91276	36.967	49.162	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) The acting is about the same {clears throat} Nicolas Cage serves up a big, hammy helping of his balding, cheesy smile and attempt at charisma
91276	34.473	37.339	0.0	6	 (umm) It's more comical than serious
91276	50.856	56.036	0.3333333432674408	9	 (uhh) The only thing that really was interesting about this movie was the setting

92521	9.739	17.903	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm) It wasn't really advertised too much (uhh) probably with good reason they were probably embarrassed that they made it
92521	24.037	30.544	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (umm) The action, the fighting was good I suppose but (uhh) everything else was terrible
92521	20.235	23.909	-1.6666666269302368	4	 It had very little plot
92521	37.616	49.262	-2.0	7	 But (uhh) not for their acting abilities, mostly and it was mostly eye candy but (umm) yeah, it was pretty bad movie I'd stay away from it
92521	32.188	38.616	2.0	6	 (uhh) Well I guess (uhh) the cast was, the cast was good I liked the cast
92521	58.957	61.464	-0.3333333432674408	9	 So (uhh) yeah
92521	50.107	59.608	-2.3333332538604736	8	 (umm) I wouldn't even rent it unless you're very, very bored but there are a lot of better movies out there and give it a two out of five
92533	57.391	63.18	-2.3333332538604736	10	 I guess probably closer to a zero, but I guess it rounds up
92533	6.447	12.595	-2.0	1	 It was awesome, and (uhh) very misleading
92533	0.0	7.387	0.0	0	Hey (uhh) This is a review of Pathfinder which (umm) you've probably seen the trailer
92533	16.634	21.036	-2.6666667461395264	3	 It was (uhh) it was terrible
92533	12.593	17.464	-2.6666667461395264	2	 (uhh) You see the trailer was awesome but the movie (umm) was terrible
92533	31.35	39.773	-0.6666666865348816	5	 (uhh) The CG, FX fight scenes all that, they were good but it wasn't enough to save the movie at all
92533	20.495	30.664	-2.6666667461395264	4	 (umm) The story was not (uhh) not up to par and the acting was pretty lackluster
92533	48.391	50.06	-2.0	7	 (umm) I would avoid it
92533	40.23	47.356	-2.3333332538604736	6	 (umm) But yeah it was, it was (umm) pretty bad show on their part
92533	52.951	58.391	-2.6666667461395264	9	 (umm) I'd give it a (uhh) one out of five if I could
92533	49.06	53.732	-2.3333332538604736	8	 It's it's (stutter) not entertaining at all
92tWNUhG9DY	0.0	3.825	-1.3333333730697632	0	so called alternative fake news media shill
92tWNUhG9DY	22.81	32.919	0.0	3	If there is anger and violence, the illuminati will win, and then, the balance of the relationship between order and chaos, shall be broken
92tWNUhG9DY	15.785	23.74	-0.6666666865348816	2	To prevent the next step of the illuminati master plan, people need to be in control of their emotions
92tWNUhG9DY	35.93	39.594	0.0	5	This trap, was the Trump Card
92tWNUhG9DY	31.919	36.331	-1.3333333730697632	4	They have set the trap for the sheeple, and the sheeple fell for it
92tWNUhG9DY	42.166	48.174	-0.6666666865348816	7	Tell me in the comment section below, what do you think of all this madness
92tWNUhG9DY	38.594	43.166	0.0	6	Now, the New World Order, shall rule supreme
93821	59.017	63.4	0.6666666865348816	11	 It was really trying to jazz up the series for the teenage market I think
93821	54.358	60.017	1.3333333730697632	10	 (umm) But the actual movie has kind of a fun soundtrack, it was real popular at the time, had some of the more popular bands
93821	72.706	75.911	-1.0	13	 And honestly some of the action isn't as great as it could be
93821	62.4	72.509	-1.6666666269302368	12	 As you can see from the DVD cover here it's got motorcycles and fire which are two things that are are (stutter) fun in the movie, but the acting is terrible
93821	81.227	85.839	-1.0	15	 So check it out if you're bored, but if you're not don't bother
93821	75.041	82.017	-0.6666666865348816	14	 So while this can be a a (stutter) slightly fun movie I would probably only give it a two out of five
93821	84.839	87.944	-1.6666666269302368	16	 Go see the original Jurassic Park instead
93821	0.79	4.753	-1.6666666269302368	1	 I'm here to give you a video review of a terrible movie
93821	0.281	1.71	1.3333333730697632	0	Hi
93821	8.143	15.498	-2.0	3	 Now I I've (stutter) honestly found the entire Mission Impossible movie series has been somewhat lacking
93821	4.94	8.315	0.3333333432674408	2	 Mission Impossible Two, starring Tom Cruise
93821	19.816	24.987	-2.0	5	 The second one was probably the best out of all three, the third one was just terrible, not even worth mentioning
93821	14.748	19.679	-1.3333333730697632	4	 The first one had a insanely convoluted plot and was just difficult to follow
93821	37.596	42.537	1.3333333730697632	7	 Now one thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was the technology they used called the facemaker
93821	24.695	38.237	-0.3333333432674408	6	 This one is a hundred and twenty-three minutes long, so it's pretty long, and it follows (uhh) Tom Cruise's character as he tries to stop the deadly Chimera virus from attacking the world
93821	52.083	54.151	0.6666666865348816	9	 It looks really weird
93821	42.864	53.083	1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) It allows the characters to make an exact copy of someone's face and then sneak in somewhere and then pull it off, and you never expect it until they actually pull it off
93839	63.627	71.351	-2.0	11	 So (uhh) if someone gives you the DVD watch it, but I wouldn't spend any money on it like I did
93839	59.686	64.058	-1.3333333730697632	10	 It has some funny moments but overall it's just not that great
93839	70.85	73.008	-2.3333332538604736	12	 This was kind of a waste of money
93839	1.698	9.941	-2.6666667461395264	1	 Tonight I'm going to be reviewing a terrible movie called Killer Klowns From Outer Space
93839	1.049	2.278	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi {sigh}
93839	16.224	19.679	0.0	3	 It was made by Orion Pictures Corporation
93839	9.3	17.224	0.3333333432674408	2	 Now this is pretty much, I mean it's released by MGM but it was a very independent sort of movie
93839	21.463	33.498	0.3333333432674408	5	 It's rated PG-thirteen and it is about killer clowns who are from outer space and they land in a field near a small town and they proceed to take, take (stutter) over
93839	18.679	22.463	0.3333333432674408	4	 It's very short, only eighty-six minutes long
93839	42.225	53.073	-1.6666666269302368	7	 But, I mean, as you can probably expect with a movie titled Killer Klowns From Outer Space the movie is just full of terrible acting and bad cinematography
93839	32.946	42.178	0.0	6	 And the movie also follows a group of teenagers who set out to destroy the clowns and reclaim what's rightfully theirs, their hometown
93839	55.964	60.267	-1.6666666269302368	9	 So that I would just, I would give it a two out of five
93839	52.682	56.425	-0.3333333432674408	8	 It's a fun concept but they just didn't really pull it off that well
94215	57.311	63.978	-1.0	11	 (umm) Supertroopers was still, very was still pretty realistic like yeah it's, it's (stutter) still comedy and it's far fetched
94215	47.743	56.465	-2.0	10	 But overall the story is just, you know it's just campy and it's too cliche horror parody
94215	63.667	70.833	-1.0	12	 But this people I mean, I mean (stutter) I don't know I guess you know horror is so far fetched with people come back to life but this one is just not very good
94215	2.236	6.299	-2.0	1	 This movie is very bad I'm giving it two out of five stars
94215	0.0	3.127	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi I'm Tom and I'm reviewing broken lizards Club Dread
94215	10.148	13.323	2.3333332538604736	3	 They were both really, really funny
94215	5.659	10.58	0.3333333432674408	2	 I loved broken lizards' first two films, Puddle Cruiser and Supertroopers
94215	17.172	22.832	-2.3333332538604736	5	 However this movie is not anywhere on that level, it's, it's (stutter) bad in my opinion
94215	12.922	17.723	1.6666666269302368	4	 Supertroopers is one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to know they're now making a sequel
94215	29.554	33.218	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) And it's just not very funny
94215	22.46	28.958	0.3333333432674408	6	 It follows the broken lizard gang as they own a resort in the Caribbean
94215	45.189	48.294	1.0	9	 (uhh) There are some humorous taunt moments in it
94215	33.136	45.081	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) (stutter) There instead of being a cop parody, this is a horror parody and I feel there have been enough horror parodies done the past few years and this one is not very, very good
94983	51.514	57.074	-2.3333332538604736	11	 You could probably get it for under five dollars now, since it's so old and so bad
94983	47.134	52.405	-2.6666667461395264	10	 So I didn't really like this DVD, a waste of fifteen dollars
94983	61.661	64.786	0.0	13	 And it's called Final Fantasy seven
94983	56.673	62.102	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (umm) I definitely don't suggest this to anyone who's played the video game, because it will ruin the game for you
94983	1.757	8.245	0.6666666865348816	1	 Today I'm going to do my Expo review on this DVD movie called Final Fantasy seven
94983	0.0	2.757	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi, everyone
94983	10.637	17.663	0.6666666865348816	3	 So it has the movie and then it has other scenes, clips, and other games or whatever on the second disc
94983	8.293	11.637	0.0	2	 (umm) This is the two-disc special edition
94983	25.573	28.19	-2.3333332538604736	5	 This DVD, however, sucks
94983	17.073	26.174	0.6666666865348816	4	 It came out a a (stutter) year or two after the the (stutter) Playstation game that was Final Fantasy seven, which was a great game
94983	29.005	35.603	-1.6666666269302368	7	 It was all basically, it's basically the game, but you just get to watch all the scenes in a movie form
94983	27.379	29.556	-1.0	6	 I really didn't like it
94983	41.427	47.526	-2.0	9	 He doesn't look very (umm) heroic, like I thought he would have been in the game
94983	35.491	42.028	-2.0	8	 (umm) And it makes Cloud, the main character, look like a real big, like, sissy or something

96099	67.837	70.523	-1.6666666269302368	11	 I thought overall the movie stunk
96099	64.046	68.159	-1.3333333730697632	10	 And I think the kids need positive twists, not negative twists
96099	70.411	90.428	-0.6666666865348816	12	 You know, I mean it was good, but it wasn't good because of the twists it had and I'm not going to tell you what the twist was, but you'll see what it is, and I usually like to have children's movies that have happy, happy movies throughout the entire movie and not to have disappointment in the movie
96099	0.361	4.144	0.3333333432674408	1	 Today I'm reviewing the movie Bridge to Terabithia
96099	0.0	1.361	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi
96099	8.761	14.79	0.0	3	 (uhh) one is a girl that just moved in, the other is a boy that lives close to this girl
96099	3.164	8.514	0.0	2	 In this movie the main, the two main characters are young children
96099	20.525	29.497	0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) if you see the previews, the previews shows a lot of animation and a lot of, like (uhh) fictional characters that are in the movie
96099	14.049	20.288	-0.3333333432674408	4	 The girl had never really made very many friends, and the boy really doesn't have that many friends either
96099	35.122	48.414	-1.0	7	 (uhh) it really didn't have that many fictional characters or (stutter) they actually had every character that was shown, but they're only there for like, if you took the whole movie, maybe a minute and a half, two minutes
96099	29.694	35.114	-3.0	6	 (uhh) this is, to me, this movie was a very big disappointment
96099	57.64	64.836	-2.3333332538604736	9	 (uhh) I was disappointed also in in the (stutter) how the movie (uhh) had a twist and it was a negative twist
96099	48.521	57.353	-2.3333332538604736	8	 So, it was more, (uhh) you know, it, it (stutter) really didn't have the imaginary characters that you think the movie would have throughout the entire movie
96179	47.952	50.11	-0.3333333432674408	11	 Garfield loves lasagna

96179	55.126	56.874	-1.0	14	 CGI was stupid
96179	60.574	65.066	-2.0	16	 (uhh) I can't really say much more because I think I'm going to go insane in front of this box any more
96179	5.579	9.941	-2.3333332538604736	1	 Now I didn't buy this movie, I don't think anybody bought this movie

96179	17.202	22.932	0.0	4	 (umm) The the (stutter) best thing I can say about this movie is that it comes in a fancy orange DVD case
96179	29.205	35.313	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (uhh) I don't know why (uhh) someone like Billy Murray would (uhh) slum it doing this

96179	42.245	47.127	0.0	9	 (umm) The movie pretty much (uhh) (stutter) follows the plot of the (uhh) the daily comic
96179	34.583	41.19	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) The other stars in the movie are Brecken Meyers and Jennifer Love Hewitt, but they're washed up it's not surprising they're in a movie like Garfield
96194	54.996	67.241	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (umm) The only thing redeeming about this (uhh) movie, was about a thirty second cameo by (umm) Gavin Rossdale, which is a rock singer
96194	51.644	54.889	-2.0	10	 (umm) I couldn't wait for this movie to be over
96194	71.14	75.741	-1.6666666269302368	13	 (umm) This is not a good movie to watch with your girlfriend
96194	67.957	71.721	-0.6666666865348816	12	 (umm) That was the only thing I liked about this movie
96194	75.23	77.328	-2.0	14	 (umm) I didn't enjoy it
96194	7.385	12.266	0.0	1	 (umm) This is a romantic comedy
96194	0.929	7.098	0.0	0	Hello, I am Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie, Little Black Book
96194	17.342	20.038	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) It wasn't very romantic
96194	12.423	16.746	-2.3333332538604736	2	 But I really didn't enjoy it that much I have to say
96194	22.041	24.698	-1.6666666269302368	5	 It just didn't work
96194	19.836	22.682	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) The jokes weren't really that funny
96194	31.29	34.735	-1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) It was slightly choppy at times
96194	24.097	31.532	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) The chemistry (stutter) between these two people, (umm) it just doesn't work
96194	49.978	52.085	-0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) It drug out
96194	35.58	49.551	-1.0	8	 (umm) This is definitely a chick flick, I think (umm) many teenage girls would probably enjoy it and you know, I don't really mind (umm) romantic comedies (umm) if they're good but this one just didn't work

96350	61.641	67.311	-0.6666666865348816	10	 I think it promotes high schoolers to go buy Honda Civics and make them wice wockets

96350	15.207	19.469	-2.6666667461395264	3	 This is a terrible movie
96350	9.839	16.207	0.0	2	 But The Fast and the Furious starring Paul Walk, Paul Walk, Paul Walker and Vin Diesil
96350	22.68	29.287	-2.0	5	 It's about people that race cars (uhh) I don't understand the whole concept of it
96350	20.425	23.261	-0.6666666865348816	4	 (uhh) There's really not much to say
96350	39.791	48.134	-1.0	7	 Let's put forty to fifty-thousand dollars into this car and then go racing and be like, Oh, what's up man? You've got a ten second car
96350	29.764	39.803	-1.3333333730697632	6	 Okay, let's, let's (stutter) spend ten-thousand dollars on a Honda or a Toyota, something that sounds like you're about to go mow my yard
96350	48.142	62.551	-2.6666667461395264	9	 Why don't you take your money and go buy a viper? Why don't you go buy something that's actually fast and has a lot of muscle and enough torque to actually, like, bend your little honda civic in half or something? So overall I don't understand the concept
96350	47.573	48.912	-2.3333332538604736	8	 No
96361	53.889	60.496	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (uhh) I think it, I think it (stutter) spends too much time talking about the problems they have
96361	50.806	53.791	0.6666666865348816	10	 But it's a decent movie
96361	61.442	71.212	1.3333333730697632	13	" I was, when I saw this I thought it's like ""oh man, it's going to be a great movie cause it's gonna be about a great football team who had a great season"
96361	60.005	62.392	-1.3333333730697632	12	 It's not enough football
96361	73.385	85.998	1.6666666269302368	15	 And actually it's kind of funny (uhh) not many people know their story and they actually lost in that state championship football game so it really wouldn't have surprised me when they lost cause I knew that was coming
96361	71.918	74.135	-0.6666666865348816	14	""" (umm) No, it's not about that"
96361	119.879	124.052	-2.0	17	 So Friday Night Lights, one out of five
96361	85.687	120.879	-1.3333333730697632	16	 But overall bad movie just from the simple fact that wasn't a lot of football, but if you're watching it because you want to see a drama of what it's like to see, you know, high school kids pushed to the limit for a sport, you know, and it breaks them down and, you know, even the reality of all some kids can do is play football and if they get hurt, you know, and they can't go play college they're pretty much stuck, you know, in that small Odessa town doing nothing and that's kind of sad, and I don't want to know about that stuff, because I know it exists but no reason to see it
96361	2.665	4.633	0.0	1	 Winning's too hard
96361	0.41	3.496	-1.6666666269302368	0	Oh I don't wanna play
96361	7.923	14.032	0.0	3	 Yeah, well that's what they sound like in the movie with Billy Bob Thornton, Friday Night Lights
96361	4.182	8.504	0.0	2	 We're so good everybody wants us to win state
96361	13.92	19.05	0.0	5	 I don't know if if (stutter) anybody watches, follows Texas football
96361	13.032	14.92	0.0	4	 It's about Odessa Permia
96361	29.205	35.383	1.6666666269302368	7	 This is back when (uhh) it was actually (uhh) Mesquite Carter, I think is what it was
96361	18.05	30.205	1.3333333730697632	6	 Back in the early nineties Odessa Permia was, they're like the hot shots back when North Mesquite Stallions, Odessa Permia, that's what this is about except this was before the Stallions were awesome
96361	37.087	51.257	-2.0	9	" I am not a, personally I am a all-state athlete so I, I don't understand this whole ""everybody wants us to win, it's so hard"" that I don't I don't, I don't (stutter) get it when people complain about stuff like that"

98442	72.317	76.949	-0.6666666865348816	10	 If you've got nothing else to rent or to watch, pick this one up
98442	7.654	11.118	-2.0	1	 (umm) and I must say that I was not impressed
98442	2.735	6.649	0.3333333432674408	0	I picked up Dark Blue on the recommendation of a friend

98442	10.976	27.302	-1.6666666269302368	2	 (umm) I was not really familiar with Kurt Russell outside of a few TV movies that I'd seen on TNT or TBS and I should have taken a clue from those movies because (uhh) he just, as a lead actor he just does not carry this role
98442	33.924	36.67	-1.0	5	 He can't deliver the one liners well
98442	31.041	34.815	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (stutter) His dialogue just comes across as cheesy
98442	41.577	56.395	-1.6666666269302368	7	 If you're looking for (umm) a movie about corrupt cops and the battle from within, I would recommend Training Day or (umm) I like Confidential over Dark Blue (uhh) any day of the week
98442	37.865	42.577	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) And all in all, just, I just was not entertained by this movie at all
98442	67.268	73.317	0.0	9	 It's not , it's not (stutter) a bad movie, it's just definitely not a great movie
98442	59.257	68.268	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) There are some memorable lines here, but again the acting just really didn't deliver with the kind of conviction needed to make this movie believable

9cSJglGi9Pg	87.922	94.758	0.3333333432674408	13	He represents the ideology that current tradition is the best and that if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.

9cxlcpbmrH0	101.78	112.528	0.6666666865348816	13	More importantly, the boy doesn’t go on to describe the various fish throughout the story as though he were expecting them, but only acknowledging that it was possible.
9cxlcpbmrH0	98.009	102.58	1.3333333730697632	12	The boy clearly likes fishing so he isn’t wasting his time.
9cxlcpbmrH0	111.707	116.14	1.3333333730697632	14	It’s here that the definition of hope is most strongly carved out.
9cxlcpbmrH0	118.542	134.797	1.3333333730697632	16	It’s more about acknowledging that something could happen, but if it doesn’t, the individual can move on and continue to hope another day.

9cxlcpbmrH0	20.774	34.495	-0.6666666865348816	2	The boy explains that while McElligot’s Pool isn’t the best place to fish, the pool might be connected to the open sea through underground channels, which opens the possibility that anything could be in the pool.
9cxlcpbmrH0	44.371	54.33	1.0	5	As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of the power of the word “Might” and ultimately the power of hope.
9cxlcpbmrH0	62.02	71.032	0.3333333432674408	7	And this is important because he’s not saying that it’s so, but the boy does defend that it is possible, though not likely.
9cxlcpbmrH0	53.46	62.601	0.6666666865348816	6	Throughout the story, the boy uses “might” quite a bit when describing the different types of fish that could be connected to McElligot’s Pool.

9pzn93kdP_g	63.407	70.942	0.0	10	Inside your water softener, there are little tiny beads of resin, millions of them probably.
9pzn93kdP_g	108.734	122.914	0.0	13	The problem is, your resin really likes to hold on to those cations, and it clings with a great deal of effort to many of them, especially iron, and especially manganese.
9pzn93kdP_g	90.605	109.495	0.0	12	Well, when the resin is regenerated and cleaned by taking the salt solution from the brine tank and washing over that resin, it's knocking all of those positively charged ions that it collected off, and sending them down the drain in the waste water.

A8plGi4rbxM	34.245	62.54	-2.0	5	 So let me reiterate again the two main components of the alternative to this bad deal:  First, instead of allowing Iran to preserve and develop its nuclear capabilities,  a better deal would significantly roll back these capabilities – for example,  by shutting down the illicit underground facilities that Iran concealed for years from the international community.
A8plGi4rbxM	24.297	32.479	-2.6666667461395264	4	At the same time, Iran continues its unbridled aggression in the region and its terrorism throughout the world.
A8plGi4rbxM	88.701	99.387	0.6666666865348816	8	Instead of making dangerous concessions to Iran,  now is the time for the international community to reassert and fortify its original demands for a better deal.

AggyS1coOb8	7.235	108.527	0.3333333432674408	1	 I went over the four main product types along with her down payments and seller's concession in this video we're going to take a look into the conventional loan for a single-family home so if you see here we have a minimum down payment of three percent now that is if you are a first time homebuyer or have not had a property interest in a home in the past three years you can qualify for that three percent otherwise you're looking at a five percent down payment at minimum and then we have a three percent seller's concession now that's if you're putting anywhere from three percent to ten percent down if you put ten percent to twenty percent down the seller's concession goes up to six percent and any more than twenty percent it goes all the way up to nine percent that's a great feature of the conventional loan we have a minimum FICO score here of 620 gift funds get funds are allowed and two months of reserves so that means two months of a pity payment or mortgage Payment principal interest taxes and insurance so that's after your down payment and closing costs you're going to need to have at least two months of mortgage payment for reserves and then your mortgage insurance varies now what's great about the conventional loan is that the mortgage insurance goes away after you pay down twenty-two percent of the home so you have a seventy-eight percent LTV or once you have to twenty percent mark you can get your home assessed our appraised and if there's enough equity in the home they will take away the mortgage insurance or you can just put twenty percent down to begin with and not have to worry about it but very small fee to get into a home

Az3e1Opu0LE	26.92	35.423	1.3333333730697632	3	It's good to know all of these words so that when the interview asks you that, you'll be able to understand it and respond back accordingly
Az3e1Opu0LE	17.222	26.294	0.3333333432674408	2	so, there's obviously lots of words in the English language and they all have similar means, like school, college university
Az3e1Opu0LE	40.729	46.658	0.0	5	Question 1: What are you going to study
Az3e1Opu0LE	35.201	41.729	1.0	4	So, let's go ahead and get started
Az3e1Opu0LE	50.227	52.634	0.0	7	What are you going to major in
Az3e1Opu0LE	46.845	50.459	0.3333333432674408	6	It could also be asked: What's your major
B1B71X_SmwY	85.078	99.637	1.3333333730697632	11	 And so what we see is, a new products being created, new opportunities, but most of it is still it's still early days I would say, and so you can look to your financial advisor, you can look to your philanthropic advisor, for opportunities that they may have for you to get involved
B1B71X_SmwY	73.464	85.699	1.3333333730697632	10	 So terms of transfer impact investing it's definitely growing a lot, there's a lot of interest, a lot of banks are coming into it, you see a lot of philanthropists who want to find ways to do impact investments overall
B1B71X_SmwY	112.845	120.32	1.3333333730697632	13	 So obviously you can give, but my advice would be to always stay close to the work
B1B71X_SmwY	98.687	113.526	0.6666666865348816	12	 You know I strongly believe that philanthropy is about expressing your passion, expressing your view for what the world can be, and from what I've seen it's really important for people to keep that connection and keep that flame lit
B1B71X_SmwY	128.849	134.119	1.0	15	 Whether that's deploying your skills or finding new ways to get involved
B1B71X_SmwY	119.32	129.849	1.0	14	 Stay close to the people who are trying to help, are not only for your own motivation, but because you'll learn and through that connection more change will happen
B1B71X_SmwY	142.797	151.17	1.0	17	 So many of the challenges in the world today are because there's so much separation, and it's up to each of us individually to overcome that separation
B1B71X_SmwY	133.458	143.488	0.3333333432674408	16	 The gentleman named Bryan Stevenson who has founded Equal Justice Initiative, a top piece of advice that I've heard him give which I really embrace is to get proximate to a problem
B1B71X_SmwY	150.509	156.618	1.6666666269302368	18	 So what I try to do and what I see the best philanthropist doing is overcoming those boundaries
B1B71X_SmwY	9.47	15.588	0.3333333432674408	1	 So it could be a loan, it could be an equity investment, it could be a guarantee, there's lots of ways you can structure it
B1B71X_SmwY	0.0	10.011	1.6666666269302368	0	So impact investing is investing to make social change using something other than a grant
B1B71X_SmwY	22.999	30.175	0.6666666865348816	3	 So, impact investment should not be seen as a substitute for philanthropy, but rather an additional thing that you can do
B1B71X_SmwY	14.957	23.899	1.6666666269302368	2	 The way I like to think about it is, can you broaden your tool chest chest beyond grant-making but still be thinking philanthropically about the kind of investment that you're making
B1B71X_SmwY	36.688	43.405	0.6666666865348816	5	 But if that thing needs to happen again you or somebody else needs to give another grant
B1B71X_SmwY	29.175	37.349	1.3333333730697632	4	 And obviously the difference is when you make a grant you give money, hopefully something very good happens in the world
B1B71X_SmwY	53.131	61.953	0.6666666865348816	7	 But then that capital can be recycled and so hopefully they will not always need another grant another grant to keep on doing the good work that they do
B1B71X_SmwY	42.834	53.512	1.0	6	 At its best what you can do with an impact investment is deploy that capital, that capital can be used by either nonprofit or for-profit to do the work that they do
B1B71X_SmwY	65.243	74.005	1.3333333730697632	9	 We do that primarily by investing in early-stage companies that serve poor customers, and also investing in leaders who we think and make a difference in the world
B1B71X_SmwY	61.132	65.904	1.6666666269302368	8	 Yeah so what Acumen does is we are investing in entrepreneurial solutions to poverty

BAi3ZJo5Vwg	22.959	46.059	0.3333333432674408	4	For household items, electronics, furnishings, baby good, things like that that you would be donating to a Goodwill or a Salvation Army, you can determine the fair market value of those by looking at various sites online and just trying to find out what - what an item of the approximate age and condition would be selling for.
BAi3ZJo5Vwg	59.646	71.142	0.0	7	So for any of those types of furnishings, just try and find a source online that would have documented with a price that you can print out and put in your file with the photograph, that would be adequate documentation to provide fair market value.
BAi3ZJo5Vwg	52.093	60.356	0.3333333432674408	6	They also do recommend for those types of items, that you document the quality of the piece by taking a photograph and keeping that in your file.

CE9yV4SearE	14.349	31.592	-0.3333333432674408	2	There's basically two different types of these, the first one is when the insurance company says 'hey we want to send you for an independent medical examination' but make no bones about it, these are rarely independent when its the insurance company that is scheduling these.
CE9yV4SearE	41.288	47.546	-0.3333333432674408	4	In fact, I don't call them an independent because it is a defense medical examination.

Once the workers' compensation doctors have said you are good as you are going to get, and they have provided you with an impairment rating, Iowa law says that you have a right to see a doctor of your own choice.

E0g6nae4Ae4	153.273	168.341	1.0	24	 That project is still in development, it's too soon to talk about and we will see what happens but you'll start to see the divide between equity in traditional shares and safe models and the cryptoequity model start to blur perhaps over time

E0g6nae4Ae4	144.792	154.243	1.3333333730697632	23	 Right now there is a [inaudible 00:02:27] project, which is a bridge between the old world of equities and the new world of cryptoequities

E0g6nae4Ae4	-0.488	3.825	1.6666666269302368	0	What's up party people? It's Chris Derose
E0g6nae4Ae4	16.254	24.119	1.0	3	 There's a lot of different definitions going around, and it's kind of up in the air so in many senses it's what we make of it at this stage, but there's a couple things that we know it is
E0g6nae4Ae4	13.201	16.766	1.3333333730697632	2	 We think that cryptoequities are going to be something pretty different
E0g6nae4Ae4	26.092	33.039	0.0	5	 Counterparty assets are digital assets, they don't take up space per say, or they might but they aren't managed by a central authority
E0g6nae4Ae4	23.458	26.753	1.3333333730697632	4	 Right off the bat we have counterparty assets
E0g6nae4Ae4	40.499	50.668	0.6666666865348816	7	 Of course in the case of counterparty, and of course in the case of cryptoequity, there is no central holder, or central clearing house or central repository for these equities
E0g6nae4Ae4	32.408	41.499	0.3333333432674408	6	 In some ways they're kind of parallel to what you would see perhaps in a DNS model with domain names being handled as a scarce resource by the ICAN [SP]
E0g6nae4Ae4	55.934	66.772	1.0	9	 In traditional equity terms, we have things like stocks so maybe you have a website venture, or maybe you have a new VC funded or Crowdfunded venture that you want to do
E0g6nae4Ae4	49.988	56.535	0.0	8	 They exist as assets, assets themselves are up to users to define and you can call these assets whatever you'd like
E0g6nae4Ae4	73.145	75.991	0.6666666865348816	11	 Maybe you have 1,000 shares or 100,000 shares
E0g6nae4Ae4	65.772	74.145	1.3333333730697632	10	 You can define shares, you can define the name of your company as an asset name and you can declare that to the network and you can declare that as having x number of shares
E0g6nae4Ae4	79.8	84.222	0.0	13	 They are just tokens that are themselves a percentage of a a whole
E0g6nae4Ae4	75.62	80.8	0.0	12	 Maybe these are non-divisible shares, thee are non-divisible in the sense that they don't have sub-units
E0g6nae4Ae4	88.53	92.912	0.6666666865348816	15	 Cryptoequities can also be things like tied to tangible goods
E0g6nae4Ae4	83.262	89.191	0.6666666865348816	14	 Those would be a very bare bones definition of what a cryptoequity is but it goes a little bit further from there
E0g6nae4Ae4	107.707	117.277	0.3333333432674408	17	 In some senses, in that case it's a bit centralized and requires trust upon the person declaring the asset but certainly is doesn't require trust on the part of the clearinghouse or the counterparty agent
E0g6nae4Ae4	91.912	108.357	1.0	16	 Maybe you have a bank of gold or copper or some such thing and you want to declare to the network that you are the holder of that repository, that it is yours but the equity itself is decentralized and it is declared on the network and it represents some fractional holding of that store of that traditional commodity
E0g6nae4Ae4	122.034	125.229	1.3333333730697632	19	 These could be things such as karma perhaps
E0g6nae4Ae4	117.165	122.675	0.6666666865348816	18	 That would be another use for cryptoequity, but there's more exotic definitions of cryptoequity as well

EoC83JhkCAw	44.949	51.566	0.6666666865348816	10	In this closet I keep lots of medications, and cleaning supplies, and then I keep the sheets at the very bottom

F59hwsm4Ld0	174.744	178.328	-0.6666666865348816	42	 Well then you're just going to think that you wasted $500
F59hwsm4Ld0	177.328	182.07	-0.3333333432674408	43	 So even if you're house is perfect, they're still going to find issues that are wrong with it
F59hwsm4Ld0	101.72	104.227	0.6666666865348816	23	 Don't worry about things that are $100 or $50
F59hwsm4Ld0	103.227	109.515	0.6666666865348816	24	 Focus on the things that are thousands of dollars and tackle those first
F59hwsm4Ld0	108.515	115.062	1.0	25	 So find out from your home inspector what their thoughts are on the most expensive items
F59hwsm4Ld0	114.082	119.402	0.3333333432674408	26	 And finally, the third thing you should be asking your home inspector is, 'Mr

F59hwsm4Ld0	190.289	192.636	1.0	46	 Kind of a role reversal
F59hwsm4Ld0	191.726	198.453	1.3333333730697632	47	 If they, the home inspector were purchasing, what would their priorities be? Okay, that's all I got for you today
F59hwsm4Ld0	181.09	185.592	0.0	44	 So I think those are the top three questions that you need to be asking your home inspector
F59hwsm4Ld0	184.901	191.289	2.0	45	 Safety, monetary value, and then the third question is if they were the purchaser
F59hwsm4Ld0	118.402	124.521	0.6666666865348816	28	 Home Inspector, if this was your house that you're purchasing, what would be your top priority?'
F59hwsm4Ld0	123.521	129.18	1.0	29	 Now this is kind of tricky because depending on how you word it, they may not be so inclined to answer
F59hwsm4Ld0	159.898	171.304	0.3333333432674408	40	 If your house is perfect and there's nothing wrong with it, the home inspector is still going to find things wrong that will need to be fixed because they need to do their job and show that they are doing something for $500
F59hwsm4Ld0	170.304	175.505	2.6666667461395264	41	 Because if they give you a report that is empty, that shows everything is good
F59hwsm4Ld0	2.316	9.432	1.3333333730697632	1	 In this video, we're going to be talking about the top three questions you need to be asking your home inspector
F59hwsm4Ld0	-0.488	3.316	1.6666666269302368	0	How's it going everyone? Matt Leighton and welcome back to another video
F59hwsm4Ld0	12.952	20.138	1.6666666269302368	3	 It's Arlington's first new elementary school in over 10 years and it's a net-zero energy school
F59hwsm4Ld0	8.432	13.952	1.3333333730697632	2	 I'm here in Arlington, Virginia, I have the new Discovery Elementary School behind me
F59hwsm4Ld0	22.211	25.436	0.6666666865348816	5	 It produces everything it consumes
F59hwsm4Ld0	19.138	23.211	2.3333332538604736	4	 Meaning it doesn't consume any extra energy
F59hwsm4Ld0	26.721	28.579	1.0	7	 You know what I'm talking about
F59hwsm4Ld0	24.436	27.721	1.3333333730697632	6	 It consumes everything it produces
F59hwsm4Ld0	31.2	36.501	1.0	9	 Let's talk about the top three questions you need to be asking your home inspector
F59hwsm4Ld0	27.579	32.081	1.6666666269302368	8	 I'll put a link in the description below so you can learn a little bit more about Discovery Elementary
F59hwsm4Ld0	43.752	49.94	1.0	11	 It could be thousands of dollars, it could be hundreds of dollars, whatever the case may be, your safety is paramount
F59hwsm4Ld0	35.501	44.752	-0.6666666865348816	10	 Question number one: what is the biggest safety issue that you're seeing? Guys, you're going to be negotiating a lot of money in the home inspection
F59hwsm4Ld0	49.798	52.854	0.3333333432674408	13	 That should be your top priority
F59hwsm4Ld0	61.761	81.399	0.0	15	 The absolute first question you need to be asking is, 'what is the biggest safety concern?' Question number two is, 'what is the biggest monetary fix that you see?' What is the biggest monetary item out there? And this one can be a little bit tricky because the home inspector might not know the exact cost but they are certainly going to know the most significant item
F59hwsm4Ld0	51.854	62.701	-0.6666666865348816	14	 And the safety issue might be as small as a couple GFCI outlets or it might be something as large as structure damage or the entire electrical needs to be redone or something of that nature
F59hwsm4Ld0	81.756	85.01	1.3333333730697632	17	 If you're buying a house or a townhouse
F59hwsm4Ld0	80.678	82.756	0.0	16	 That is number two
F59hwsm4Ld0	86.974	93.002	1.0	19	 They could range in value from $20 up to maybe $5,000 or even $10,000
F59hwsm4Ld0	84.05	87.674	0.6666666865348816	18	 You might have something like 20 - 25 items come up
F59hwsm4Ld0	132.251	135.905	0.6666666865348816	31	 But if you word it correctly, I think they can answer that
F59hwsm4Ld0	128.18	133.251	-0.3333333432674408	30	 They may want to kind of excuse themselves and not get in the way of your purchase
F59hwsm4Ld0	158.631	160.708	1.0	37	 Because, let's face it

Fmwc7wkIc4Q	73.953	79.074	0.3333333432674408	13	 For example, in monopoly we have no choice but to buy things that monopoly; there are no substitutes

GpRDC-S88dM	205.444	215.314	2.0	26	 You can check out my vlogs from San Francisco down here, that was the most epic way of breaking a New Year's resolution ever! So I hope you enjoy
GpRDC-S88dM	214.314	217.948	0.6666666865348816	27	 Thanks everyone, cheerio! Subtitles by the Amara
GpRDC-S88dM	137.659	153.894	1.0	20	 Because I have various stories and experiences that might help somebody who's going through similar things at the moment So if those videos were to help even just one person then that would totally make this whole thing worth it
GpRDC-S88dM	153.832	163.811	1.0	21	" And the final thing I would like to do in 2017 is something that I'm always trying to do and that's ""visit a place that I've never been to before"""
GpRDC-S88dM	163.32	171.743	0.3333333432674408	22	 And that could be like a foreign country or a city or it could even just be somewhere near my house that I've never visited before
GpRDC-S88dM	171.202	179.356	1.6666666269302368	23	 The possibilities are endless, this is a big world and I feel like I want to experience as much of that as possible
GpRDC-S88dM	11.715	17.544	0.6666666865348816	1	 So now it's time to make that same video for 2017
GpRDC-S88dM	0.0	12.196	1.6666666269302368	0	Hi everyone! 2016 is almost finished and that seem so crazy to me because it feels like yesterday I was sitting down and talking about the things that I'd like to do in 2016
GpRDC-S88dM	21.034	23.101	1.6666666269302368	3	 I hope you enjoy
GpRDC-S88dM	16.544	21.854	1.0	2	 So here goes, here are the things that I would like to do in 2017
GpRDC-S88dM	28.337	36.92	0.6666666865348816	5	" Now this would be ""stop moaning altogether"", but I feel like moaning is therapeutic sometimes, it can really help solve a problem"
GpRDC-S88dM	22.61	28.768	1.3333333730697632	4	 The first thing I would like to do in 2017 is stop moaning about petty things
GpRDC-S88dM	44.68	60.257	2.6666667461395264	7	 And deep down I know that I'm very lucky and I'm very grateful for everything that I have so I should start verbalizing that and verbalizing how grateful I am for things instead of sounding unappreciative
GpRDC-S88dM	36.439	45.041	-1.0	6	 But sometimes I find myself moaning about the most trivial things and I think it's just because I'm bored
GpRDC-S88dM	66.63	74.405	1.0	9	 Whenever I come to watch a movie, I tend to pick my favorites but maybe it's time for me to find some new favorites
GpRDC-S88dM	59.317	67.131	1.6666666269302368	8	 In 2017, I'd also like to watch 25 movies that I've never seen before
GpRDC-S88dM	80.538	88.493	1.6666666269302368	11	 So I'm setting myself the goal of finding 25 new movies for me to watch and let's see how that goes
GpRDC-S88dM	74.223	81.409	1.3333333730697632	10	 There's so many movies out there that I've never seen before and maybe if I just watched them I'd find that I like them very much
GpRDC-S88dM	101.381	116.359	0.6666666865348816	13	 Now that sounds quite simple when I'm in a good mood, but I want to be more conscious of how I make people feel when I'm in a bad mood because sometimes I snap, sometimes I'm grumpy, you know, everybody has those moments
GpRDC-S88dM	88.061	101.782	0.3333333432674408	12	" My next goal for 2017 is something that sounds quite simple, but I think it's quite a challenge and I think it's something that everybody has to work on, on some level and that's ""be nice to everybody"""
GpRDC-S88dM	121.505	125.588	2.0	15	 And I don't wanna pass that on, I want the world to be happy
GpRDC-S88dM	116.197	121.976	-1.0	14	 And being grumpy can be infectious if you answer in the wrong way to somebody
GpRDC-S88dM	127.761	131.864	0.3333333432674408	17	 I don't want to be that person that makes somebody feel horrible
GpRDC-S88dM	124.588	128.761	1.0	16	 So that's just something I'd like to do
GpRDC-S88dM	134.675	138.269	0.3333333432674408	19	 12 videos is like one every month or so
GpRDC-S88dM	131.183	134.727	1.0	18	 I'd also like to make 12 videos that help

JF-5nlUNx_g	147.586	163.991	2.3333332538604736	21	 But this coming week, we're going to have more fun in the sense that you're not aware that hard, because you're going to be using a flatbed scanner and you're going to be a bit shocked at some of the wonderful images you can get from that
JF-5nlUNx_g	163.37	168.96	2.6666667461395264	22	 So in any event, we hope we're going to create something wonderful for you

JF-5nlUNx_g	9.27	18.102	0.0	3	 I think that what we'll probably say now more than anything else is a quick conversation about the equipment
JF-5nlUNx_g	5.838	9.712	1.0	2	 We are now starting week one of the course
JF-5nlUNx_g	24.745	29.058	0.3333333432674408	5	 Now, first of all, I am not requiring anything of you
JF-5nlUNx_g	17.871	25.456	0.6666666865348816	4	 Many of you are concerned that I'm being a little too picky in what I'm requiring of you
JF-5nlUNx_g	32.946	41.2	1.0	7	 My hope is that you'll like what I make-- the images that I make-- and follow my lead
JF-5nlUNx_g	28.058	33.946	1.0	6	 What I'm doing is showing you what I do and my technique
JF-5nlUNx_g	54.348	63.27	-0.3333333432674408	9	 It is not going to work for you if you are going to just use a snap and shoot, or whatever you call it these days
JF-5nlUNx_g	40.759	54.709	0.0	8	 And for the most part the exercises that we've developed really are intended to be used with a 105 macro lens on a camera that can take lenses
JF-5nlUNx_g	72.437	85.42	0.3333333432674408	11	 It is true that you can, on occasion, use extension tubes instead of-- for example, let's say you don't have as much of a macro lens as you'd like
JF-5nlUNx_g	62.639	72.659	0.3333333432674408	10	 You really want to meet the standards, if I could say that, that we are suggesting you pay attention to
JF-5nlUNx_g	92.192	101.912	0.3333333432674408	13	 But you'll be losing f-stops in the process, and you'll find out more about aperture and f-stops in the oncoming weeks
JF-5nlUNx_g	84.918	93.192	0.0	12	 And so you can use tube extensions as long as they don't have any glass
JF-5nlUNx_g	110.69	116.958	0.6666666865348816	15	 And the ideas in the course will be appropriate for your needs as well
JF-5nlUNx_g	101.351	111.371	1.3333333730697632	14	 So those of you who are technically savvy, I hope that you'll find what our exercises have become developed into
JF-5nlUNx_g	129.357	136.503	1.3333333730697632	17	 And you'll probably say, why is she doing that? Well I'd like to hope that I'm going to be making a case for that
JF-5nlUNx_g	116.217	130.028	0.3333333432674408	16	 But just getting back to the equipment, for example, when we get up to using a camera and a lens, which is in a week two, you're going to see that I'm going to suggest using software
JF-5nlUNx_g	142.088	144.595	1.6666666269302368	19	 It works for me

KQ86HmgwUns	82.324	98.969	1.0	8	Another important thing to note is that when they talk about a tax-free mutual fund, again we're referring to the interest income, you may buy a bond, tax-free bond mutual fund that's exempt from federal and state taxes, so you're not getting any interest income and paying taxes on that.
KQ86HmgwUns	30.422	39.264	0.0	3	For example, not all tax-free mutual funds that you're going to buy are going to be free from federal, state and local taxes.
KQ86HmgwUns	55.665	66.063	0.0	5	So you have to take a look at the documentation and read the perspectives to make sure that it truly would be for your situation and your residency free from federal, state and local taxes.
KQ86HmgwUns	124.598	135.077	0.3333333432674408	11	So there are some things to consider when you're taking a look at a tax-free mutual fund to make sure it truly is going to be tax-free for your situation ,and that you do understand the tax ramifications for your situation.

KSyX-lejDcc	55.844	66.073	0.3333333432674408	7	So the big innovation sort, if clean energy at lower costs that focus on costs and access to poor people.

NDMAVMZyISM	10.019	23.47	0.3333333432674408	3	They gave me a ton of information, showed me examples of some properties, what returns would be, you know, all the costs they consider—maintenance, vacancies—all of that, taxes, insurance
NDMAVMZyISM	3.134	11.019	0.6666666865348816	2	I went through the process of an initial interview, talked on the phone with a turnkey company—really a great experience
NDMAVMZyISM	37.376	44.951	-1.6666666269302368	5	It’s really tough to do that with a turnkey property, almost impossible, especially the buying below market value part
NG7QLq4XlWo	115.509	130.547	0.0	11	 Assume that your ideal applicants are going to be viewing that on a mobile device, so you need to make it lean, and then, when you’re actually working on the copy, instead of using terms like “we, our, me,” use terms around “you
NG7QLq4XlWo	112.176	116.19	1.0	10	 Write your job description as if it’s mobile first
NG7QLq4XlWo	132.77	135.925	1.0	13	 Allow them to see themselves in that job
NG7QLq4XlWo	129.547	133.46	0.6666666865348816	12	” Frame the job description around the actual reader
NG7QLq4XlWo	154.859	172.911	1.0	15	 How are you conveying that job to them in a way that’s going to get them excited and help you close them? That spirit is what you should be taking into the job description and into the copy that you’re writing, to actually build something that is going to actually compel people to convert, and in this case conversion will be applying to that actual job
NG7QLq4XlWo	134.925	155.61	1.3333333730697632	14	 Use “you, your, and yours,” so a reader can actually see themselves in that role, and, when you’re writing the role, don’t write it from a compliance standpoint so that it’s just written in a way that checks all the boxes but doesn’t actually compel me to apply; write that job description as if you’re sitting across the table from your very best candidate
NG7QLq4XlWo	13.78	20.906	0.3333333432674408	1	 Job descriptions are sadly, one of the least involved tools in our recruiting playbook
NG7QLq4XlWo	0.0	14.062	2.3333332538604736	0	So, for recruiters that may be new to recruitment marketing, every one of you has a tool that has incredible visibility, even today, that is one of your leading recruitment marketing tools that you may not even be aware of, and that’s job descriptions
NG7QLq4XlWo	26.94	41.589	0.6666666865348816	3	 So, instead of taking that template job description off the shelf and reusing that for your next hire, you know, look at the job description, look for opportunities where you can actually tweak that and make that more appealing to the audience you’re trying to connect with
NG7QLq4XlWo	20.116	27.661	0.6666666865348816	2	 Though they’re one of the resources, one of the recruitment marketing vehicles have done right, that have more reach than most anything we do
NG7QLq4XlWo	51.844	57.174	2.0	5	 All these things will make your job descriptions more appealing to job seekers
NG7QLq4XlWo	41.138	52.844	0.6666666865348816	4	 A lot of ATSs these days actually have increased some of their functionality so you can do things like embedding photos and images inside of job descriptions, embedding videos, adding hyperlinks
NG7QLq4XlWo	69.463	74.315	1.0	7	 Another thing that you should really consider is the copy of the job description
NG7QLq4XlWo	56.174	69.675	2.0	6	 It’ll help you tell the story that you’re trying to tell beyond just the core duties and responsibilities of that job description, and bring them to life even more which will ultimately help you create a more informed applicant and attract the right applicant
NG7QLq4XlWo	106.03	113.176	0.3333333432674408	9	 So, when you’re re-thinking the copy of that job description from a recruitment marketing standpoint, think about copy
NG7QLq4XlWo	74.163	107.03	0.0	8	 This to me is really one of the biggest things that hold recruiting organisations back, because again, you rely on old templates that were likely written by a hiring manager, that’s an unrealistic laundry list of responsibilities and qualifications, and it’s something that a job seeker is not going to want to take the time to go through, particularly a passive job seeker, and even more particularly, a passive job seeker or any job seeker who is looking at that job description on a mobile device, which, for many organisations, is more than half of your potential audience, is reading that job description

NzpymNJaFjo	5.848	18.621	-0.3333333432674408	1	But I think it’s very, very important, again, back to the point of no advertising campaign being an island, no advertiser really needs to be an island or should-- can not be an island themselves.
NzpymNJaFjo	17.761	42.756	1.3333333730697632	2	So they have to really-- really be, not only initiate, but be a relevant part of the dialogue with their media vendors, with their agencies, because they’re-- unlike in years past, where the advertiser spends their dollars and how they-- how they interact with these media vendors is really gonna shape media, digital media.

O3whFU2lAAk	110.67	120.091	0.3333333432674408	8	And we're taught as instructors never to tell your class that this is your first time doing it because it illicit sympathy, not certainly during the class.
O3whFU2lAAk	25.424	40.561	0.3333333432674408	2	Well, the class was to be ended up by, I set the class up to be a three-hour class and I was going to deliver some extra information and I figured that after about an hour, hour and fifteen minutes, I would give the class a break to use the restroom and then I would finish up the class.
O3whFU2lAAk	70.661	77.298	0.3333333432674408	5	So short enough when the class resume fifteen minutes later after the bathroom break, I couldn't help but say something.

OEOkmrKvTUo	0.0	8.794	0.6666666865348816	0	Okay, we're talking about different styles of improv comedy, and the more you learn about improv the more you'll find out there's these different kinds you can study.
OEOkmrKvTUo	31.889	56.286	1.3333333730697632	4	Narrative long form, you can think of it more like an unscripted play, so you could do an unscripted cop show, or an unscripted movie, I even do unscripted Broadway musicals, where we make up all the singing and dancing on the spot, and that's narrative long form, so scenes I do in the beginning where you see one of my characters, you'll see them evolve throughout the show.
OEOkmrKvTUo	69.134	82.047	0.6666666865348816	6	It happens to be that I know I mentioned theater sports, another style of improv, a lot of people that begin with studying theater sports end up doing narrative long form because both of those formats have a narrative or story based root.

OFBc3z99bIc	139.564	166.146	2.0	25	And especially with somebody who is from the car business, it's really a very nice feeling to walk in and be comfortable and feel like I could have just walked right out the door with my diamond and they would have treated me just as nicely as they did when they actually purchased it.
OFBc3z99bIc	68.985	77.268	0.3333333432674408	12	Now my son, being the computer savvy person that he is, is sitting next to me while Timothy is getting the numbers for what that diamond is worth.
OFBc3z99bIc	83.212	92.473	-0.3333333432674408	15	I'm in the car business, and when we take cars in on trade or we buy them off the street from somebody, we don't give them over wholesale book because you don't make money that way.
OFBc3z99bIc	79.112	83.554	0.6666666865348816	14	They ended up giving me $500 over wholesale for that diamond.
OFBc3z99bIc	124.189	128.502	0.3333333432674408	22	You get an idea of what you're looking at,  and then you can make your decision from there.
OFBc3z99bIc	52.552	62.432	2.3333332538604736	10	So I kept it, and I thought that that part of it really made me feel even more comfortable and confident, the fact that he wasn't trying to buy everything.
OFBc3z99bIc	100.204	107.839	2.0	19	So not only did I become one of their clients for selling, I'm sure I will become one of their clients for purchasing as well.
OFBc3z99bIc	95.554	101.204	1.3333333730697632	18	And then I found out they've got a store next door that sells handbags and all kinds of other stuff.
OFBc3z99bIc	4.8	9.612	0.3333333432674408	1	So I figured I might as well cash some money out of it, rather than just letting it sit around.
OFBc3z99bIc	0.0	5.8	0.3333333432674408	0	I had a large diamond that I wanted to sell, and it was from a relationship that I'm no longer in.
OFBc3z99bIc	29.794	35.742	0.3333333432674408	6	So we ended up making an appointment, came down, met a guy named Timothy, who is a gemologist.
OFBc3z99bIc	107.846	115.332	1.6666666269302368	20	 So I just would recommend anybody that has anything they even just want looked at, even if you don't really want to sell it.
OFBc3z99bIc	114.332	124.91	0.6666666865348816	21	I've got a girlfriend who has some really old antique jewelry, and I told her even if you don't want to sell it, because there is no pressure at all, at least take it in and let them take a look at it.

OHWyYVux-yw	19.956	35.523	1.6666666269302368	2	Marketing trip wire is basically a low ticket product offering that solves a specific problem in your prospects life, and you put it at such a low price and you add such high value to it, that it becomes an irresistible offer.
OHWyYVux-yw	44.73	52.913	1.3333333730697632	4	Because once somebody has opened up their wallet and bought from you, then you have a much higher chance of selling them other things on the backend.
OHWyYVux-yw	85.906	94.569	0.6666666865348816	7	The most effective way to combat this is using native advertisements which is just a fancy term for ads that look similar to the content around them.
OHWyYVux-yw	74.163	86.168	0.0	6	One thing that you need to understand is that online advertising is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off successfully using the traditional methods because people are simply becoming blind to them.

OKSx1zxHGpQ	180.282	188.405	0.6666666865348816	25	 I did some videos on how to deal with in terms of answers to that question but this information should help you here in today

OKSx1zxHGpQ	145.022	150.162	1.0	21	 Now the final thing you wanna do is gather as many business cards as possible
OKSx1zxHGpQ	149.302	155.351	0.6666666865348816	22	 I didn�t want this to happen but this is probably the most important thing you should do and then follow up with these people afterwards
OKSx1zxHGpQ	154.56	172.961	0.3333333432674408	23	 Give them a call and just ask them, �Hey, are you open to additional streams of income? You know, you can probably phrase it a little bit better than that but actually follow up with these people saying, �Hey, you know we had a conversation about TLC or whatever and I just want to follow up and just to see if you are actually open to what we�re doing business wise
OKSx1zxHGpQ	20.964	27.98	1.3333333730697632	1	 So my favourite place to order business cards is Vista Print, a very reliable company, they haven�t failed me yet
OKSx1zxHGpQ	0.0	21.684	1.0	0	Hi there, Seb here, and if you are looking for tips on Total Life Changes business cards and some tips on how to use them you are definitely in the right place and if you want some more training on hot to build your TLC business and generate some more sales you can go on my website here at any time but in this video I wanna give you some tips that will help you to get more contacts for your business and expose your business to more people
OKSx1zxHGpQ	29.674	38.785	2.0	3	 I would recommend ordering through Vista Print and there is a link in my video description inbox if you haven�t actually got a link already of where to buy business cards
OKSx1zxHGpQ	26.98	30.424	1.3333333730697632	2	 I�ve had tons of orders through them they have served me for years
OKSx1zxHGpQ	42.555	44.832	1.0	5	 Go to networking functions
OKSx1zxHGpQ	38.155	43.555	1.0	4	 Now the next thing we do is that we network locally in order to hand these business cards out
OKSx1zxHGpQ	47.384	56.026	1.0	7	 There must be something in your area or maybe you have to travel a bit but it�s definitely worth networking, gong to these events at least once a month
OKSx1zxHGpQ	44.191	48.384	0.0	6	 Look locally and see if there is anything for local business owners
OKSx1zxHGpQ	63.008	68.169	-0.6666666865348816	9	 They will find any living breathing soul and just tell them all about their business
OKSx1zxHGpQ	55.415	63.799	-0.3333333432674408	8	 Now the problem is, most networkers in TLC and other companies, they will go into these networking events and they will just throw up information
OKSx1zxHGpQ	79.461	84.551	1.0	11	� Maybe you can say something like this, �I get paid to help people lose weight
OKSx1zxHGpQ	67.338	80.391	0.3333333432674408	10	 This is the wrong way to go about it, you want people asking you what you do and you wanna make it interesting so instead of you saying, �I am a distributor in TLC,� what you wanna say is, �I get paid�
OKSx1zxHGpQ	89.318	97.712	1.3333333730697632	13	 And they will say well, how does that work then? And you would say, �well one we help customer lose X amount of weight in X amount of time
OKSx1zxHGpQ	84.05	90.318	1.3333333730697632	12	� So that�s actually quite interesting and then people can ask you more and you just tell them but in snippets of information
OKSx1zxHGpQ	103.536	114.733	1.3333333730697632	15	 You want people asking you questions and you are able to just give them small snippets of information and if they are really interested then you can have them take a look at your website or video or something like that
OKSx1zxHGpQ	97.41	104.536	0.6666666865348816	14	� And you keep it short and sweet because the shorter you keep it, less is more especially in networking
OKSx1zxHGpQ	117.704	138.399	0.6666666865348816	17	 My favourite thing to do, I�m not actually in TLC by the way, I�m in another company but my favourite thing on flyers that I hand out for my network marketing business is, I like to put my picture on the flyer, so when I speak to this person and we have a conversation, they�ll take the flyer home, they�ll see my picture and the rapport is kind of regained because they will actually�
OKSx1zxHGpQ	114.391	118.415	0.3333333432674408	16	 Now the next thing you wanna do is actually personalize these Total Life Changes business cards
OKSx1zxHGpQ	139.824	142.071	0.0	19	 They remember that conversation
OKSx1zxHGpQ	137.559	140.824	0.6666666865348816	18	 They will remember me just from seeing my picture

OOh1_ffKOKk	12.004	25.146	-0.3333333432674408	3	So being able to understand that, and respect that, within the consumer experience, and what you test, what you pilot is not necessarily what gets replicated when you go to mass.
OOh1_ffKOKk	7.504	12.834	0.6666666865348816	2	It is two way, not one way, and then looking at it as multiple ways.

amem5EmRG3s	35.6	63.34	1.6666666269302368	3	 Well Meditated &amp; Liberated really has been a culmination of so much life experience and really is the wisdom that we've been able to take as a result and I think if I look at Meditated &amp; Liberated in the way of what is it it's I know so many people that are aware of where their stuff in their lives but they just don't know how to get unstuck
amem5EmRG3s	25.733	35.323	2.0	2	 And so, maybe you could share a little bit with our viewers what will be, where we'll be going and what they can expect

bBJ0BxmIocQ	181.499	192.446	1.3333333730697632	21	 Otherwise I hope you found this video informative and feel more comfortable understanding what dividends are and how they work in the stock market and why they can do so much for you
bBJ0BxmIocQ	19.677	28.22	2.3333332538604736	1	 I love being a dividend investor and I think dividend paying stocks and ETFs are an essential in every Millennial's portfolio
bBJ0BxmIocQ	0.0	20.597	1.6666666269302368	0	Hey guys, Bridget from Money After Graduation here and I wanted to answer a common question I hear all the time and that's, what are dividends and how do I get them? Dividend investing is one of my favorite ways to invest in the stock market and it's one of my strongest passive income streams that I have coming into my wealth portfolio
bBJ0BxmIocQ	33.296	39.264	1.0	3	 When you buy stock in a company, you're essentially becoming a part owner of that company
bBJ0BxmIocQ	27.359	34.226	1.3333333730697632	2	 To understand what a dividend is, you really just have to understand what it means to be a shareholder of a company
bBJ0BxmIocQ	42.265	52.644	1.6666666269302368	5	 Because you're now a part owner of the business, you're entitled to some of the rights and privileges of being an owner in the business and that includes the profit
bBJ0BxmIocQ	38.264	43.235	0.6666666865348816	4	 You're giving them your money in exchange for a piece of their company
bBJ0BxmIocQ	59.576	72.389	0.3333333432674408	7	 You don't have to do anything, all you need to do is purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date and then you will receive your payout proportional to the number of shares you own on the dividend payout date
bBJ0BxmIocQ	51.854	60.576	0.0	6	 So dividends are usually a cash distribution that's paid quarterly or sometimes monthly to shareholders in a company
bBJ0BxmIocQ	78.164	83.145	1.3333333730697632	9	 All you need to do is own the stock, and you don't need to take any action after that
bBJ0BxmIocQ	71.389	79.164	1.6666666269302368	8	 This is what makes dividend investing so attractive and so easy it's because it really is passive income
bBJ0BxmIocQ	92.751	101.702	1.0	11	 One of the things that makes dividend investing so attractive is companies often raise their dividends every year, typically by 10% to 15%
bBJ0BxmIocQ	82.364	93.421	1.0	10	 The money is automatically deposited into your brokerage account, then you can use it to buy more shares in the same company, buy shares in another company, or to withdraw and spend it
bBJ0BxmIocQ	106.739	116.828	1.3333333730697632	13	 Most stocks will pay dividends in the range of about 1% to 3%, but you can definitely get stocks that pay seven, eight, or even double-digit dividend rates
bBJ0BxmIocQ	100.702	107.41	0.0	12	 This means the longer you own a stock, the more you're making on your original investment
bBJ0BxmIocQ	120.677	125.468	0.6666666865348816	15	 So high dividend payers are usually riskier stocks
bBJ0BxmIocQ	116.068	121.418	0.6666666865348816	14	 It's important to remember when you're chasing these dividends that rate reflects risk
bBJ0BxmIocQ	139.734	151.37	0.3333333432674408	17	 Like with all investing, there are associated risks, the main one of dividend investing being that the company could reduce or even eliminate its dividend entirely
bBJ0BxmIocQ	124.848	140.574	1.0	16	 Nevertheless, owning a mix and a diversity of low dividend payers and high dividend payers because you have low and higher risk stocks in your portfolio is a great way to diversify your investments and increase your overall passive income
bBJ0BxmIocQ	161.015	172.172	0.6666666865348816	19	 Otherwise shareholders are the most important people to a corporation so they will go to great lengths to continue to pay that dividend, pay it on time and increase it year over year
bBJ0BxmIocQ	150.37	161.966	-0.3333333432674408	18	 Now this is extremely rare because it makes shareholders mad if you stop paying them, so a company will only cut or eliminate its dividend is it's facing dire financial straits

c805Td8A_Ek	65.063	70.643	1.0	15	And so when I look at what we're doing now, I feel like we have blended those very nicely.
c805Td8A_Ek	123.98	134.717	1.3333333730697632	22	So I think with this project, this research project, we've kind of blended the two which I think really makes a nice fit because students really do appreciate technology.

c805Td8A_Ek	13.82	26.264	0.3333333432674408	2	The research project that I'm working on right now is kind of comparing the old method that I used to the new method and doing a little bit of action research here within my own area.
c805Td8A_Ek	96.592	107.27	1.0	20	So we've added that technology element in so that the students can use the technology that they really appreciate such as PowerPoint in those presentations.

cEXJ2zFbC9I	5.04	29.407	0.0	2	It seems that hedge fund professionals, professional investors are no investing in puerto rican debt that the prices are so depressed that these investors now feel like there is a significant upside to investing in Puerto Rican debt and they are willing to make the bet that Puerto Rico will make a significant comeback.
cEXJ2zFbC9I	75.141	89.39	-2.0	5	And the tragedy is, because they were wiped out, they aren't going to be able to participate in any Puerto Rican bond or debt recovery, or Puerto Rico recovery, if and when it returns.

cOcNe3L4VAg	85.717	93.691	0.0	13	 By having all of these platforms integrated, we're able to see where we can automate processes to help streamline and create efficiencies

cOcNe3L4VAg	103.396	111.909	1.3333333730697632	15	 Ultimately, instead of aggregating all this data we're able to spend time strategically looking at the data and making business decisions that can really impact the bottom line

cOcNe3L4VAg	23.638	30.085	1.3333333730697632	3	 The first, is that MarTech really puts a priority on systems integrations or MarTech stacks

cOcNe3L4VAg	29.674	38.087	0.6666666865348816	4	 What's a MarTech stack? It's when you can visually represent and categorize all of the different marketing technology platforms your company uses
cOcNe3L4VAg	44.58	55.976	0.3333333432674408	7	 So from that first touchpoint to the last, how are customers experiencing your brand? By having integrated platforms, we're able to create smarter, and more strategic and personalized campaigns
cOcNe3L4VAg	41.208	45.58	1.0	6	 The second reason is that MarTech really looks at the whole customer journey
cOcNe3L4VAg	57.68	66.652	1.0	9	 From strategic media placements and dynamic content, to the sales process and marketing automation, we're able to unify that marketing message

d0QNH2vcDgU	130.605	137.092	1.6666666269302368	21	 So it's really a culture of 100% promotion from within it's a great jump off opportunity to start a career

d0QNH2vcDgU	21.303	28.668	0.3333333432674408	4	 You want someone, at this level, that's obviously interested in these career fairs, someone that's not interested is not gonna be here
d0QNH2vcDgU	37.267	42.188	1.0	7	 It's just somebody that's going to come in and work hard no matter what they're going to do
d0QNH2vcDgU	35.181	38.267	1.6666666269302368	6	 That's the biggest thing that I think that we look for
d0QNH2vcDgU	43.702	47.336	0.0	9	 I've been coming, I think this is my fifth year, doing this fair

d0QNH2vcDgU	97.749	113.635	2.0	15	 You get a good broad base of different areas so I feel like we've recruited some individuals from here so it's from the fair so it's been really really nice
d0QNH2vcDgU	71.858	96.983	1.3333333730697632	14	 We have an office here in Charlotte in addition to eight others in North Carolina and in the Charlotte market, we know that UNC Charlotte provides great programs that are relevant to what we're looking for, so coming here gives us the exposure and the access to these students to catch them before they graduate! We really like UNCC's career fairs we've been coming for the last, probably, I don't know, four years - as long as I've been with the organization
d0QNH2vcDgU	112.895	124.072	2.0	16	 We have a tremendous relationship with UNC Charlotte and the majority of our interns actually come from UNC, so we look at this as an opportunity to bring people onto our organization, developing train

d38u9n5GOLM	77.685	87.006	2.6666667461395264	15	It’s the very first Wanted Adventure bag that she’s made, and I’m hoping in the future there will be more like this, please Mom.
d38u9n5GOLM	66.241	78.086	2.0	14	As a hobby, my mom like to sew and knit and make quilts and other cool stuff like that, and for 10,000 subscribers she made me this awesome Wanted Adventure bag to give away.
d38u9n5GOLM	113.074	118.484	1.0	22	And don’t forget the places need to be all over the world, so not just in Germany.
d38u9n5GOLM	90.196	97.991	1.6666666269302368	18	Well, as you can see, the clocks behind me are missing something: cities or towns to go with them.

e7_2U4lm6TE	56.383	64.437	2.0	10	But what's inside is really what matters, right?! You don't want to pay $10 for a box, at least I don't!

e7_2U4lm6TE	13.541	21.185	0.3333333432674408	3	You pay $10 a month, that's what I did, and every month you get a box from Birchbox with some of their picks for you.
e7_2U4lm6TE	6.806	14.541	0.6666666865348816	2	Birchbox is a subscription makeup company that sends you products every month.
e7_2U4lm6TE	32.328	45.45	0.6666666865348816	5	But the problem is, if you're like me, you have drawers full of just samples of so much stuff, like lipsticks you never use, eye shadows you never use, etc., so you really don't need it unless it's really good!
e7_2U4lm6TE	20.185	32.4	1.6666666269302368	4	And you put in your preferences based on your age, what you like, the kind of products that you like to buy and they're supposed to match that to your likes and send you stuff that's supposed to be really awesome.
e7_2U4lm6TE	45.807	51.457	1.3333333730697632	7	So, what you get from Birchbox is this pink box that comes in the mail.
e7_2U4lm6TE	63.437	70.104	1.0	11	They send you a card that shows you what's in the box and, what the value is of each item in the box.
e7_2U4lm6TE	69.104	72.259	0.3333333432674408	12	I didn't know that they were not going to be full sized products.
e7_2U4lm6TE	72.826	79.683	1.3333333730697632	14	So, you're paying $10 to get basically four samples, and then a little extra freebie that they put in.

eTn2P4wmFr4	67.508	75.452	-1.6666666269302368	11	That delay, that uncertainty is very negative, as indeed would be tariffs on Britain because after all, Britain is the world's original trading nation.
eTn2P4wmFr4	83.601	87.146	0.0	13	Remember, Great Britain is less than 4 percent of world GDP.
eTn2P4wmFr4	75.171	84.352	-0.3333333432674408	12	But again, for the rest of the world, I don't think this hurts the European Union that much, outside of Britain, and I think it has got negligible impacts on the United States.
eTn2P4wmFr4	93.449	97.342	-0.6666666865348816	15	And then finally, for financial markets, you know, this was a shock.
eTn2P4wmFr4	102.0	105.983	0.3333333432674408	17	But they were shocked, and so you had shock and disappointment the day after.
eTn2P4wmFr4	117.035	129.729	1.0	22	And so what we've seen in the days following Brexit is that people have realized, yes, this is a big splash for Britain, but it's a small ripple for the rest of the world.
eTn2P4wmFr4	96.342	102.84	-0.3333333432674408	16	People expected, and maybe they shouldn't have expected, I don't think they should have expected that this would be an easy win for the Remain Campaign.

eTn2P4wmFr4	11.645	18.891	-1.0	2	And for all of them, what happens to Britain and what happens to the United Kingdom is far more damaging than what's going to actually happen for the rest of the world.
eTn2P4wmFr4	23.658	36.68	-1.3333333730697632	4	I think Britain's biggest problem is actually Scotland, which may well vote to be independent of the United Kingdom, going forward, if that means it can be part of the European Union, which it would now get pulled out of.
eTn2P4wmFr4	42.056	48.583	-2.0	7	I don't see another country that will want to follow Britain's lead because I think what Britain is doing to itself will be pretty damaging.
eTn2P4wmFr4	54.458	58.341	0.3333333432674408	9	From an economic perspective, I think also, the big problem is for Britain.
eTn2P4wmFr4	48.262	54.38	0.3333333432674408	8	And in terms of political implications for the United States, or for India, or for China, I think those are pretty minor.

Alright so my suggestion to you, is to learn the top side effects of each drug classification so that you'll never be lost
faXGVcVcVsE	76.398	82.506	1.0	6	 The next thing you should know is to look in detail at the side effects of the drugs
faXGVcVcVsE	123.91	131.784	0.0	9	 I also think it's very important that when you're studying the diseases that you understand the top drugs that treat that disease
faXGVcVcVsE	106.609	124.59	2.0	8	 if you can understand the top side effects or the overall side effects of a particular classification of drug then you'll be able to you know, answer that question with ease because you'll be able to eliminate those that definitely don't belong in that classification

gXuiIWRxrw4	119.46	135.815	1.0	13	 Why you put them in there, how they're used, and create this fantasy, draw them into you know your home and why you did it this way and how you use it, how others have used it, why they use it that way, why the location is primed for different things
gXuiIWRxrw4	92.89	120.051	0.3333333432674408	12	 They could have just said breakfast China, lunch utensils, terrace, but instead they painted the picture: Enjoy having breakfast on the cozy terrace which do you think the average reader is going to be drawn towards or pay a premium for or book first? So the first tip that I would say is you really want to think about all of the things that your Airbnb listing has to offer
gXuiIWRxrw4	157.024	168.521	0.6666666865348816	15	 And like anything else it's iterative right so your first listing shouldn't be your last listing you should visit it, you should check it out, you should improve it, you should a/b test it, try different language
gXuiIWRxrw4	135.005	158.024	1.0	14	 Don't just say it's in this location, it's in this location, which means you can walk for breakfast here and you can go there for lunch and then complete the day by having a drink over here whatever it is and now somebody thinks gee you're really speaking to me the individual you're talking my language and I think you're going to find much more rewarding bookings more income and also better SEO
gXuiIWRxrw4	173.327	183.507	0.3333333432674408	17	 So really take the time and energy, invest at the time and energy in your description because at the end of the day it's going to drive revenue and that's after all why you're doing this
gXuiIWRxrw4	168.119	174.327	0.3333333432674408	16	 Some of the adjectives that you might find are really helpful you won't know on day one

gXuiIWRxrw4	22.69	30.405	1.3333333730697632	3	 The first thing I would say is Airbnb does a really good job of laying out different sections that you're supposed to fill in
gXuiIWRxrw4	14.808	23.301	0.0	2	 So this is sort of how to optimize the success of your airbnb listing using the description strategically
gXuiIWRxrw4	36.957	46.229	0.6666666865348816	5	 They check the box and so there's a bare minimum of information but don't forget this is marketing, right? This isn't just like information gathering
gXuiIWRxrw4	29.405	37.957	0.3333333432674408	4	 So they tell you in a standardized template, you know, fill this and fill this in, fill this in and I think people basically do that
gXuiIWRxrw4	54.428	57.952	1.3333333730697632	7	 They're looking for a maximum experience
gXuiIWRxrw4	45.428	55.428	0.3333333432674408	6	 People that are looking to stay at your home or your bedroom, they're looking for an experienced they're not looking for a minimum criteria
gXuiIWRxrw4	75.699	83.743	0.6666666865348816	9	 And the best listings I see really create a vivid vision of what your time might be like
gXuiIWRxrw4	57.241	76.699	0.0	8	 So one of the mistakes I see people make all the time is they just literally detail all of the criteria, the features, has TV, has Wi-Fi has this, has that, has the other, and it leaves for the guests to interpret, Well gee this is how I might use it or this is what it might mean
gZDyk95Xob4	56.752	69.107	1.0	11	So if I ever have a need or a question   about a certain item that I'm reviewing, I can count on NARPRO other car repair shop members, including the great guys   and gals over at NARPRO, to kind of help me out, so that, for us, is a very good benefit.

gZDyk95Xob4	38.254	54.649	1.0	9	Not only do we get the benefit of key consumers checking our auto shops out and going online, and ultimately coming in the auto shops to do business with us, but we get a family of other car repair shop owners that we can network with - hashing out new auto repair advertising ideas and marketing ideas.
gZDyk95Xob4	101.241	106.432	1.3333333730697632	15	So, I want to tell you we plan on being   with NARPRO for many, many years to come.

h7p5URoookk	80.419	90.199	0.6666666865348816	14	 I think a lot of people on churches look to them strongly - as perhaps they should - for advice and leadership on how to live

h7p5URoookk	114.581	116.688	0.6666666865348816	18	 So, my message to a church leader would be
h7p5URoookk	139.714	148.925	2.0	31	 And I know it is a circular issue, that if we don't support people then they won't represent our issues, but I think an important first step would be to represent these issues and introduce legislation that we can get behind on this level
h7p5URoookk	136.96	140.714	0.0	30	 And, um, I think young people could be mobilized if they saw support for these issues

he475nnmMi0	121.366	127.803	1.0	13	The easiest way to eliminate that is to take out a loan using that car as collateral.
he475nnmMi0	109.582	121.358	0.0	12	Well, so we’ve got $5,000 of equity, we’ve got $1,000 of exemption, so we’ve got $4,000 of non-exempt equity.
he475nnmMi0	127.252	151.829	-0.3333333432674408	14	So if you take out a $4,000 loan on the car using the car as collateral, then we end up with a $5,000 car, minus the $4,000 that’s owed, leaving $1,000 of equity and $1,000 of automobile exemption so there is no non-exempt equity in the car.
he475nnmMi0	163.48	181.741	1.0	16	There’s another video where we talk about the differences between exempt money and non-exempt money and how to deal with that and followup with that video to see how to deal with that $4,000 of now, non-exempt money.

he475nnmMi0	0.0	16.147	0.0	0	In bankruptcy we often deal with the situation where cars have more equity then is the exemption available to apply to the car.
he475nnmMi0	21.413	26.374	0.0	2	First of all let's just real quickly define what we mean by the word equity.
he475nnmMi0	34.483	58.002	0.3333333432674408	4	So if somebody owns a car that’s worth $5,000 and they have a $3,000 car loan $5,000 minus $3,000 the equity in the car is $2,000. So what do we do in a situation where the amount of equity in the car is greater than the amount of exemption that we have to apply to it.
he475nnmMi0	68.226	73.098	0.3333333432674408	7	I’m going to talk about two which are probably the most common.

jgNu58Da9cs	15.666	25.526	0.3333333432674408	2	And I think the way to go about doing that is trying to make some of our foreign policy research actually practical for foreign policy practitioners.

kiR5zVo2zvU	211.81	214.626	1.6666666269302368	25	 Thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
kiR5zVo2zvU	164.398	174.527	1.0	20	 I really think that weekly calls or even just a few times a month can be really helpful with checking in and making sure you're staying on track with what you want to do
kiR5zVo2zvU	173.527	183.367	2.3333332538604736	21	 So I talk to people all day long about the power of online video to share your story with the world and so I'm taking my own advice here ^and starting this new YouTube channel
kiR5zVo2zvU	182.367	187.557	2.0	22	 ^Hello, I'm Adrienne Stortz, this is my new YouTube channel about digital marketing strategy for musicians
kiR5zVo2zvU	186.717	203.351	1.6666666269302368	23	 ^So as you've been watching this video, ^what's the thing that popped into your brain that you have been wanting to just start but you've been putting off or making excuses or over-researching? Leave it in the comments, let me know what it is, and let me know what the one thing you're going to do towards starting that this week is in the comments as well
kiR5zVo2zvU	13.211	29.736	1.6666666269302368	1	 ^And this can apply to everything, whether it is sending an email blast to your list that you haven't talked to in two years or starting a YouTube channel, or running an ad campaign for your next record that's coming out, just start
kiR5zVo2zvU	2.526	14.211	1.6666666269302368	0	- Two of my best pieces of advice for musicians and creative people who want to share their work online and grow their audience and grow their engagement ^using digital strategy is to just start ^and not overthink it
kiR5zVo2zvU	45.498	64.627	1.6666666269302368	3	 And so by just starting it, you actually are moving forward and you're seeing what works and the great thing about these digital tools is you get stats right away, you can see who's responding on social media or you can see if anyone's actually clicking on your ad, if anyone's actually buying the thing you want them to buy
kiR5zVo2zvU	28.966	46.049	0.6666666865348816	2	 I think a lot of us have a tendency to sit and wait and wonder and worry and research and talk to everybody we know to get their input and try to figure out the right way to do it and then you look back and months have passed and you still haven't done the thing that you want to do
kiR5zVo2zvU	66.221	72.898	1.3333333730697632	5	 Even if you have a total crash and burn ad campaign, you learn a lot from it and your next one's gonna to be better
kiR5zVo2zvU	63.976	67.221	2.3333332538604736	4	 You get the stats right away, it's great
kiR5zVo2zvU	74.113	86.587	-0.6666666865348816	7	 ^It can definitely take the wind out of your sails if you've put money into an ad campaign for the first time or you've spent a lot of time on an email and you've sent it out to your huge list and there's no response or the response isn't what you wanted
kiR5zVo2zvU	71.898	74.983	2.0	6	 ^And once you get started, just keep going
kiR5zVo2zvU	92.182	94.539	1.6666666269302368	9	 So just keep going
kiR5zVo2zvU	85.587	92.344	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It can be really disappointing and so it's hard to try again if it didn't have the response that you wanted it to have
kiR5zVo2zvU	100.174	110.483	1.0	11	 ^How can you hold yourself accountable to do the goals that you want? Because we all sort of by default, if things get stressful, don't do stuff
kiR5zVo2zvU	93.659	101.034	1.0	10	 Ways that I keep going with my projects and I advise to my clients is just ^this concept of accountability
kiR5zVo2zvU	117.564	126.526	0.3333333432674408	13	 ^And maybe for social media, it's saying that you want to post to Twitter eight times a week or you want to post a new YouTube channel once a week
kiR5zVo2zvU	109.712	118.464	1.0	12	 And so how can you kind of trick your brain to make it happen? Accountability, and one way that I've done that ^is to just set a schedule
kiR5zVo2zvU	129.577	133.63	1.0	15	 ^Accountability can also come from ^a connection with another person
kiR5zVo2zvU	125.736	130.258	1.0	14	 Set a schedule that seems reasonable for you and then just do it
kiR5zVo2zvU	145.96	160.768	0.6666666865348816	17	 But if you don't have that, you could also just create that with other members of your ensemble, maybe you delegate who works on which things and you have a weekly check in meeting amongst all of you to see if everybody's doing what they need to be doing and how you can do better the next week
kiR5zVo2zvU	132.73	146.211	1.3333333730697632	16	 ^This could maybe be your publicist or your manager, if you have the relationship where you're talking regularly, check in and have them sort of hold you responsible that you get stuff done before your next call with them and it's sort of like you've got that assignment
kiR5zVo2zvU	163.19	165.398	0.3333333432674408	19	 You can get on the phone once a week
kiR5zVo2zvU	160.387	164.19	0.6666666865348816	18	 Or just a colleague or a friend who's doing similar work
kj63uF0RhW8	7.554	15.149	0.0	1	The first thing that you should do if you're thinking about starting a business is you figure out how much money you'll need to start that business.
kj63uF0RhW8	59.317	66.632	0.0	7	So that's a great place to start if you don't have your own money, and friends and family aren't willing to lend or gift you money.

krHZuqfXrPU	116.976	126.257	0.3333333432674408	21	 This means you have to choose your stocks and ETFs, you have to decide when to buy and sell, and your responsible for managing all your taxes and so on
krHZuqfXrPU	125.257	137.78	1.6666666269302368	22	 If that sounds like too much work, then the roboadvisor or the mutual funds are probably a better option for you, but if you want to be more in control of your money and pay the least amount of fees possible, then a brokerage account is the right fit
krHZuqfXrPU	136.86	142.121	0.6666666865348816	23	 To get started, you'll only need about $1,000 and you can begin trading right away

krHZuqfXrPU	-0.298	7.048	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi guys, Bridget from Money After Graduation here and I wanted to talk to you about getting started investing
krHZuqfXrPU	19.647	26.424	1.0	3	 You can't afford not to invest if you want to enjoy any kind of long term financial security
krHZuqfXrPU	14.0	20.597	-1.6666666269302368	2	 And as a result they miss out on hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential returns over their lifetime
krHZuqfXrPU	31.47	35.832	0.3333333432674408	5	 The first and easiest way to get started investing is mutual funds
krHZuqfXrPU	25.424	32.33	0.6666666865348816	4	 Thankfully, there's a lot of options available to you to get started no matter what your situation or understanding of the market
krHZuqfXrPU	39.392	47.975	0.0	7	 In a mutual fund, you're actually giving your money over to a fund manager who invests it in a series of stocks or other investments on your behalf
krHZuqfXrPU	34.832	40.362	0.3333333432674408	6	 These are typically available directly from your bank and you can start with as little as $50
krHZuqfXrPU	56.234	62.781	0.0	9	 When you're selecting mutual funds, look very closely at the fees so you know exactly how much you're paying
krHZuqfXrPU	47.244	56.844	1.0	8	 As a result, mutual funds typically come with some higher fees, but it really takes the load off you doing the stock picking individually so it might be a good option for you
krHZuqfXrPU	66.6	71.391	-0.3333333432674408	11	 A lot of mutual funds will have these fees as high as 3% or 4%
krHZuqfXrPU	61.811	67.6	0.3333333432674408	10	" These fees will be listed as the MER or ""mer"" fee, and you want to try to stay around 1%"
krHZuqfXrPU	75.62	81.907	0.0	13	 If you have a little bit more money to invest, and want to pay less fees, your next choice is a roboadvisor
krHZuqfXrPU	70.391	76.42	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Stay away from those, you can't afford to have that much of your return eaten up by fees
krHZuqfXrPU	86.714	94.13	0.6666666865348816	15	 All you need to do is deposit your money, and they take care of the rest, just like a mutual fund, except for at a much lower cost
krHZuqfXrPU	80.907	87.664	1.3333333730697632	14	 These are awesome online wealth management tools that you need about $1,000 to get started in a portfolio
krHZuqfXrPU	93.239	99.148	0.0	16	 For a roboadvisor, you can typically expect to spend somewhere between 0
krHZuqfXrPU	103.586	112.777	0.6666666865348816	19	 If you bank with a large financial institution they might be able to offer you their own brokerage account but otherwise you might have to look for an online brokerage provider
krHZuqfXrPU	99.395	104.506	1.3333333730697632	18	 Finally, the last option to get started investing is to open your own brokerage account

kuQWPuhnlHs	33.296	53.791	1.3333333730697632	5	First is finding a model which will drive inclusive growth without which the shining India story and India becoming a superpower which we talk about is unlikely to have a fairytale ending because there will be far too many people who will -- who will not be part of this wonderful economic growth story that we're talking about.
kuQWPuhnlHs	17.532	33.917	1.0	4	And -- and all of that, as an Indian that I read, and excited about what I read, and deeply will that to happen, there are 2 or 3 challenges that India would face if it were to face it were to become a superpower.
kuQWPuhnlHs	52.791	69.087	1.0	6	So to me, India can become a superpower provided it embraces the criticality of developing a model which will drive inclusive growth and which will get a billion-plus people fully integrated into the growth story that we have.

l8LTcZJ-_8k	17.312	23.62	0.3333333432674408	3	 What follows is my interview with Bret Tuck co-owner of Edely’s Bar-b-que in Nashville Tennessee
l8LTcZJ-_8k	12.962	17.833	1.0	2	 Lately I’ve been blogging about building a customer base from scratch
l8LTcZJ-_8k	29.594	32.18	1.3333333730697632	5	 Let’s listen to what Bret has to say
l8LTcZJ-_8k	23.348	30.045	0.3333333432674408	4	 Bret talks about how he defined his customer base, and then developed a product line to keep them coming back
l8LTcZJ-_8k	41.567	44.912	0.3333333432674408	7	 So, that’s when I decided to go to culinary art school
l8LTcZJ-_8k	32.378	42.178	1.3333333730697632	6	 After I got done with business school I sat down with my parents and told them that I actually wanted to learn a trade, versus just information on how to make money
l8LTcZJ-_8k	49.958	52.584	1.0	9	 I was in fine dining for a long time
l8LTcZJ-_8k	44.291	50.958	1.6666666269302368	8	 The reason I chose to get into a bar-restaurant or this style is because I know I can cook well
l8LTcZJ-_8k	57.351	63.908	1.0	11	 Then, tone it down so you can put a really good tasting meal on a plate for a decent price
l8LTcZJ-_8k	52.103	58.022	1.3333333730697632	10	 So I took the fine dining attitude to making stuff taste good, plate presentation and all that stuff
l8LTcZJ-_8k	70.042	78.016	0.6666666865348816	13	 That your client or your customers are just a huge wide base
l8LTcZJ-_8k	63.347	70.902	1.6666666269302368	12	 I think with that concept, especially with the way the American cuisine is going, I think that’s just a hit concept
l8LTcZJ-_8k	93.449	99.966	0.3333333432674408	15	 Versus high end where quality is not the issue, , just the amount of people who are going to be able to pay for it
l8LTcZJ-_8k	77.296	94.1	-0.6666666865348816	14	 I think that’s where a lot of restaurants get into trouble is cause they shoot for either fine dining, where only this style of people will come in, or they shoot for the Subway Franchise, which that all still make money in certain ways, and they get that low income customer coming in and quality and stuff is an issue
l8LTcZJ-_8k	116.367	119.293	0.6666666865348816	17	 This concept really hit all of them
l8LTcZJ-_8k	98.966	117.018	1.3333333730697632	16	 I think you take those skills and you come up with a concept that really reaches the customer whether it’s a family with young kids or whether it’s a family with college kids, whether it’s college kids, 35 year olds and up, and all the way up to seniors, senior citizens
l8LTcZJ-_8k	126.195	137.022	0.3333333432674408	19	 Then about 6:30 to 7:30 we have that middle age group comes in and then, or I’m sorry the elderly come in and then come around 8:00 you get all the college come in that want to have a beer and dinner
l8LTcZJ-_8k	118.692	127.075	0.0	18	 So literally we have times during the day that at 5:00 you have young children with their parents coming in from about 5:15 to 5:30 – 6:30

lp9vkkimXqg	37.376	48.324	0.6666666865348816	7	 So in about 5 days of using it, I've used it twice daily, it managed to even out my skin tone and make the pores seem less visible
lp9vkkimXqg	33.665	37.339	0.0	6	 And than I've encountered this serum
lp9vkkimXqg	50.556	54.25	0.3333333432674408	9	 You put it on and your skin just drinks it up
lp9vkkimXqg	125.875	143.318	2.0	20	 So, this serum is just like a moisture injection for your skin, leaves your skin firm, hydrated and relaxed and comfortable and together with the day cream also radiant and it finishes of the treatment very nicely, like I've said

mgovo8VYtvk	8.602	22.672	2.3333332538604736	2	 A lot of times when someone has finished writing something, they’ll say, will you proofread this? Or, will you edit this? Editing and proofreading are actually different from each other and from copyediting, even though we all understand that the author wants you to go through her work and correct errors and typos
mgovo8VYtvk	30.881	38.875	2.3333332538604736	5	 If it’s a work of fiction, then its plot structure, its character development, its world-building, its general believability, all that kind of stuff
mgovo8VYtvk	27.519	31.881	1.0	4	 An editor is concerned with the manuscript as whole
mgovo8VYtvk	46.975	56.555	0.0	7	 Proofreaders are tasked with making sure that errors are not introduced to a text as it moves from its original copy through its iterations to its final published version
mgovo8VYtvk	37.875	47.735	1.6666666269302368	6	 Reorganizing or restructuring a manuscript is called developmental editing, and if a manuscript needs a lot of rewriting or revision, it needs substantive or content editing
mgovo8VYtvk	66.51	69.875	2.0	9	 It’s about the actual print on the page
mgovo8VYtvk	55.695	67.51	2.0	8	 While proofreaders are expected to catch typos, they also scrutinize formatting, including line and word breaks, and the type specifications, such as font for headings versus subheadings
mgovo8VYtvk	233.461	237.763	1.6666666269302368	38	 The story itself is all the reader sees, and that is as it should be
mgovo8VYtvk	68.875	76.31	0.6666666865348816	10	 So we’ve gone from focusing on the story with developmental editing to focusing on the actual print with proofreading
mgovo8VYtvk	87.353	98.39	0.6666666865348816	13	This means that copyeditors perform mechanical editing, making sure that a manuscript conforms to a specific editorial style, or, if you work for a publishing house, a house style
mgovo8VYtvk	76.118	88.073	2.3333332538604736	12	 According to The Copyeditor’s Handbook author Amy Einsohn, the goal of the copyeditor is to ensure clarity, coherency, consistency, and correctness, all in service of communication
mgovo8VYtvk	102.159	121.238	1.6666666269302368	15	 Editorial style includes rules for spelling, hyphenation—is a word open, closed, or hyphentated-- capitalization, punctuation, like whether or not to use the serial, or Oxford, comma—and why would you not—treatment of numbers and numerals, and treatment of quotations to name the major ones
mgovo8VYtvk	97.61	102.82	1.6666666269302368	14	 Much of the publishing world uses The Chicago Manual of Style as their editorial style guide
mgovo8VYtvk	130.166	139.127	1.0	17	 In addition to mechanical editing, copyeditors also perform language editing, correcting grammar, syntax, and diction
mgovo8VYtvk	120.238	131.166	0.6666666865348816	16	 Copyeditors make sure all these elements are consistent throughout a manuscript so we don’t have numbers spelled out over here and in numerical form over there, or the same term capitalized on one page and lowercased on another
mgovo8VYtvk	142.777	146.74	1.6666666269302368	19	 And if there’s any question about the author’s intended meaning, I’ll ask
mgovo8VYtvk	138.127	143.777	1.0	18	 I’ll make sure the correct word is used, and that the sentence means what you want it to mean
mgovo8VYtvk	203.439	205.566	1.6666666269302368	31	 And that’s what I still do as a copyeditor
mgovo8VYtvk	196.385	204.379	2.6666667461395264	30	 I majored in English and history in college, and both those majors taught me to read critically, with purpose and focus, and a questioning mind
mgovo8VYtvk	230.587	234.361	1.6666666269302368	37	 When the editing is good, the mechanics go unnoticed
mgovo8VYtvk	226.916	231.587	2.0	36	 As a copyeditor, I commit myself to a manuscript and enjoy the fine-tuning
mgovo8VYtvk	219.502	227.576	1.6666666269302368	35	 The copyeditor will let the author know if there’s potential for something to be misread in addition to ensuring a consistent editorial style
mgovo8VYtvk	215.013	220.453	0.6666666865348816	34	 Of course the language and descriptions are clear to the author—they come from the author’s own mind
mgovo8VYtvk	210.124	216.013	1.3333333730697632	33	 You’re so familiar with the writing that your eye won’t see a mistake and instead will read it as you expect it to be
mgovo8VYtvk	204.566	211.124	0.3333333432674408	32	 Experienced writers will tell you—don’t edit your own manuscript! You’re too close to it to see it critically
mgpoY1-110U	105.691	115.062	0.0	21	Lay down and recite it line by line, or section by section, face a mirror, recite it line by line or section by section.
mgpoY1-110U	90.077	95.447	0.3333333432674408	17	By putting a movement with it, your body can connect to it better.

mgpoY1-110U	14.039	20.846	-0.6666666865348816	1	This is memorized which means you have no notes, you have no cue cards, you have no nothing.
mgpoY1-110U	51.185	57.463	1.0	7	A couple of great tips for memorizing monologues, do it one line at a time.
mgpoY1-110U	42.345	52.005	-0.6666666865348816	6	And if the monologue is not memorized solidly, you'll lose your place, you'll be floundering for words.

mjQfQx2K__8	192.833	206.375	-1.3333333730697632	25	Because if you are part of the world you cannot possibly be salt and light to them, and if you are part of the world you can never be a fisher of men, because you are of the sea.
mjQfQx2K__8	61.791	77.009	1.3333333730697632	7	BUT what I DO know is IF YOU ASK FOR THE HOLY SPRIT, IF YOU PRAY AND SEEK OF THE LORD JESUS, HE WILL GUIDE YOU BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT AND HE WILL TEACH YOU WHAT YOU MUST DO.

ogGweZUAVtU	206.801	210.954	0.3333333432674408	53	 So, those are the basic kinds of assets that we have involved
ogGweZUAVtU	199.638	207.602	0.0	52	 So, assuming we bought it from somebody else, we would do what we call amortization, very similar to depreciation, and amortize that over 20 years

ogGweZUAVtU	92.012	95.876	0.0	24	 We also have more physical type assets; like inventory
ogGweZUAVtU	95.295	106.831	0.0	25	 Inventory, specifically, we talk specifically about inventories themselves, we're generally talking about merchandise that we either are making or, at least, holding for the purpose selling

ogGweZUAVtU	14.748	18.252	0.0	3	 I want to take a deep dive in what those assets might be
ogGweZUAVtU	8.741	15.329	0.0	2	 This conversation is, basically, about the definition of the assets of the company
ogGweZUAVtU	24.566	30.055	0.3333333432674408	5	 And, we generally characterized profit, ultimately, with having a cash position
ogGweZUAVtU	18.02	24.767	0.3333333432674408	4	 First off, first and foremost, is the purpose of any business is of course to make money, and ultimately, profit
ogGweZUAVtU	33.126	35.982	0.6666666865348816	7	" We always hear the saying, ""cash is king"""
ogGweZUAVtU	29.055	33.827	0.6666666865348816	6	 So cash is the first asset really care about
ogGweZUAVtU	37.167	43.465	0.0	9	 But, we also have times where, for example, we may not require customers to pay us right away
ogGweZUAVtU	34.982	38.137	0.6666666865348816	8	 So that's the one we talk about first
ogGweZUAVtU	161.325	164.989	0.3333333432674408	39	 The other thing that we have is Intangibles
ogGweZUAVtU	155.009	160.389	1.0	38	 Accumulated depreciation, by the way, is a contra asset, which we will cover in another video
ogGweZUAVtU	45.179	50.429	0.3333333432674408	11	 Now, accounts receivable fits into this nifty little category called cash equivalents
ogGweZUAVtU	42.465	45.63	0.0	10	 So, we have these things called accounts receivable
ogGweZUAVtU	51.754	58.291	0.3333333432674408	13	 We expect within 30 days, ninety days maybe, that those items are going to be turned into cash
ogGweZUAVtU	49.798	52.754	1.6666666269302368	12	 So, we can turn it into cash very quickly
ogGweZUAVtU	58.778	62.751	0.3333333432674408	15	 That's, again, the money that our customers owe us still
ogGweZUAVtU	57.401	59.778	0.0	14	 So, we have accounts receivable
ogGweZUAVtU	65.313	68.787	0.0	17	 Pre-paid accounts are, basically, where we pay things in advance
ogGweZUAVtU	62.569	65.844	0.6666666865348816	16	 We also have things call pre-paid accounts
ogGweZUAVtU	71.2	75.302	0.0	19	 And you paid the whole year's rent in advance at the beginning of the year
ogGweZUAVtU	67.787	71.78	0.0	18	 So, think if you were to pay, for example, your rent
ogGweZUAVtU	124.878	130.288	0.3333333432674408	31	 They're not really something that we turn around and sell but it is things that we have available to us
ogGweZUAVtU	120.847	125.598	0.0	30	 But, they're just sitting in the supply closet, or wherever it is we keep those
ogGweZUAVtU	150.569	155.211	-0.3333333432674408	37	 So we have to do a thing called depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation
ogGweZUAVtU	148.454	151.42	-0.3333333432674408	36	 That is, they become less and less valuable
ogGweZUAVtU	144.882	149.454	0.3333333432674408	35	 Those fixed assets, as a general rule, depreciate over time
ogGweZUAVtU	141.989	145.353	0.3333333432674408	34	 Even vehicles would fit in Fixed Asset categories
ogGweZUAVtU	132.7	142.989	0.0	33	 Now, fixed assets are like hard physical access so like your computer, or your desks, your office furniture, the building itself, any heavy equipment that we might have
ogGweZUAVtU	130.565	133.7	0.6666666865348816	32	 We also have things that are called fixed assets

omBcvw7izuM	142.078	149.554	0.0	12	Wages are subnormal if they fail to provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial occupations.
omBcvw7izuM	179.444	186.36	1.3333333730697632	15	We hold that the night labor of women and children is abnormal and should be prohibited.

omBcvw7izuM	202.751	217.3	0.6666666865348816	19	And where, because of public necessity or for technical reasons, such as molten metal, the 24 hours must be divided into two shifts of 12 hours or three shifts of eight, they should by law be divided into three of eight.

omBcvw7izuM	0.0	15.548	0.6666666865348816	0	Our prime concern is that in dealing with the fundamental law of the land, in assuming finally to interpret it, and therefore finally to make it, the acts of the courts should be subject to  and not above the final control of the people as a whole.
omBcvw7izuM	29.784	51.886	0.0	2	The people themselves must be the ultimate makers of their own Constitution, and where their agents differ  in their interpretations of the Constitution the people themselves should be given the chance, after full and deliberate judgment, authoritatively to settle what interpretation it is that their representatives shall thereafter adopt as binding.
omBcvw7izuM	55.076	77.368	0.0	4	But in applying to present-day social conditions the general prohibitions that were intended originally as safeguards to the citizen against the arbitrary power of government in the hands of caste and privilege, these prohibitions have been turned by the courts from safeguards against political and social privilege into barriers against political and social justice and advancement.
omBcvw7izuM	84.749	101.643	0.6666666865348816	6	And to emancipate the people, in an orderly way, from the iniquity of enforced submission to a doctrine which would turn constitutional provisions which were intended  to favor social justice and advancement into prohibitions against such justice and advancement.

omBcvw7izuM	116.856	126.187	1.3333333730697632	8	As a people we cannot afford to let any group of citizens or any individual citizen live or labor under conditions which are injurious to the common welfare.
omHQ68k50XY	106.27	113.296	0.3333333432674408	13	But even if the application isn't written well, having this web application firewall gives you another line of defense.
omHQ68k50XY	112.615	121.488	1.0	14	You may not be able to check all the different ways to validate data inside of your application, but your web application firewall certainly can.
omHQ68k50XY	137.419	152.198	0.0	17	If you do a Google search for that, you'll see a lot of information about that because you don't want people have access to credit cards, and so the payment card industry came up with a series of standards that people have to follow if you store credit card information on your servers.
omHQ68k50XY	169.396	183.397	0.6666666865348816	19	So you can start to see why having something at the application level, to be able to validate input into those web fields, becomes critically important, especially when sensitive data is involved.
omHQ68k50XY	151.268	170.396	0.3333333432674408	18	One aspect of the PCI DSS standard is that you have to have web application firewalls, because if somebody is going to that ZIP code field and they are typing in something that would give them access to the sequel database, then they would also have access to, potentially, credit card numbers that might be in that database.
omHQ68k50XY	23.089	31.861	0.6666666865348816	3	You'll often see this used to make sure that when people are inputting information into a web form that that information is correct.
omHQ68k50XY	10.088	23.74	0.6666666865348816	2	A web application firewall is looking at web conversations, and it's trying to determine based on that web conversation if the information within your packets, within that conversation, is legitimate.
omHQ68k50XY	71.08	78.805	-1.3333333730697632	8	And those are very bad things, because often that does allow somebody some very detailed access to some very sensitive data.

oyHKiX5YGDE	172.759	181.631	1.3333333730697632	24	And the strength to maintain that discernment under pressure and against opposition -  that is conviction!
oyHKiX5YGDE	57.181	62.721	-0.3333333432674408	10	There is a misconception about what it means to have an open or closed mind.
oyHKiX5YGDE	81.835	91.476	-0.3333333432674408	15	But that misconception comes from an even deeper misconception about how to measure the value of an opinion.
oyHKiX5YGDE	139.903	153.844	1.0	21	So the way to determine whether someone is being open-minded is not whether he changes his mind, but whether he is willing to reevalute his opinion based upon new information.
oyHKiX5YGDE	153.183	163.901	0.0	22	And if that information is not as factual or rational as his current belief, then he is not being close-minded when he doesn't change his belief.
oyHKiX5YGDE	163.4	172.931	0.3333333432674408	23	That is called discernment - the ability to sift between truth and lies, logic and fallacies.
oyHKiX5YGDE	121.665	138.798	0.0	19	If two people are arguing and one person is using facts and reason, and the other person is using emotions and myth, then is the rational person being close-minded, because he is not changing his beliefs?

oyHKiX5YGDE	181.429	187.757	1.0	25	So yes, it is possible to have conviction and an open mind.
oyHKiX5YGDE	35.68	44.932	0.6666666865348816	6	But the irony is the moment you demonstrate conviction, someone will inevitably accuse you of being close-minded.

qJBQH14qtHc	118.931	126.456	-0.3333333432674408	21	And I think that's one of the reasons religious traditions often look back to some point in history where it seems like things weren't as fuzzy as they are now.
qJBQH14qtHc	93.649	105.354	1.6666666269302368	16	I mean, one of the fascinating things about identifying yourself within a religious tradition is that, no matter who you are, there will always be people within that very religious tradition who say that you are not Jewish or Muslim or Christian or whatever.
qJBQH14qtHc	146.688	152.307	1.6666666269302368	26	You as a nerdfighter are constantly inventing and evolving the definition of that word.

qP4uuMI-JSk	79.181	88.812	0.3333333432674408	11	And so Pardot started as a need that we had identified in the other company and so we were trying to solve our own pay point.
qP4uuMI-JSk	13.551	27.591	0.6666666865348816	3	So in eighth grade a friend of mine gave me a book called �Teach Yourself C in 21 days.� I read this book, I was in my math class and I said why not just write some software to solve my math problems� make sure that I got the answers correct.
qP4uuMI-JSk	32.637	41.41	0.3333333432674408	5	So it progressed into building websites with the dotcom boom, so I built websites for different organizations at the Duke campus.
qP4uuMI-JSk	27.469	33.088	2.0	4	That�s really what got me hooked on using software to solve different problems.
qP4uuMI-JSk	67.757	75.063	0.6666666865348816	9	So the idea for Pardot came from my experience growing the content management software company.
qP4uuMI-JSk	49.509	68.757	0.6666666865348816	8	In the Hannon Hill business, the content management software business, I would spend a lot of time on sales and marketing and in between each of the sales calls I knew there was a lot of stuff that the prospects would be doing�links they would be clicking, white papers they would be downloading, but I didn�t have any visibility into it.

qjMyjLSORY4	41.218	45.371	0.3333333432674408	7	Let's back up just a sec and talk about tailored audiences.
qjMyjLSORY4	106.988	116.429	0.6666666865348816	18	You can do the same thing with Twitter usernames and user IDs if you collect those or with mobile advertising IDs if you have your own app.
qjMyjLSORY4	44.8	50.389	0.6666666865348816	8	Tailored audiences on Twitter, to over simplify it, is Twitter's method of remarketing.
qkWdc-E6jGI	48.641	55.208	0.0	11	Now if you think again from a more myopic perspective, which is on a month-to-month basis.
qkWdc-E6jGI	107.258	111.241	0.0	24	Which is, think about, well, what role is marketing playing?
qkWdc-E6jGI	79.82	100.824	1.0	21	On the other hand, if, as a company, I understand that and I kind of know that look, one of the things that is making a customer stay with me longer is the fact that if he or she's more certain about that consumption, while I might make less money in the short run, because this person is going to stay with me longer over the lifetime, I'll end up making more.
qkWdc-E6jGI	6.816	20.307	-0.6666666865348816	2	One of the big things that is going on there is that the contract plans are so complicated that you as a consumer, when you're signing up, you have absolutely no idea what final monthly fee are you going to end up with.
qkWdc-E6jGI	24.745	29.796	-0.6666666865348816	4	If you end up consuming more, you're not exactly sure how are you going to be charged.
qkWdc-E6jGI	30.243	34.944	0.0	6	And about 50% or so of the revenue comes from this overage and underage.
qkWdc-E6jGI	41.607	46.737	0.0	8	But if I'm thinking as a firm, I'm actually banking on the fact that people are making mistakes.
qlDT-bmIzQI	0.0	19.05	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello This is the first time I have ever used a flat fee MLS Realtor service I've bought homes for sale by owner I've sold homes by owner I've used Realtors on both sides and as I said this is really my first experience and I couldn't be more pleased.
qlDT-bmIzQI	33.385	58.73	1.3333333730697632	3	Kind of screened people ahead of time I was extremely pleased with that and probably the best feature was the upgrade for a virtual tour and they came out and did a beautiful job-the home showed really well and i got lots and lots of response  ended up selling the home through a realtor and only paid two point seven percent commission.
qlDT-bmIzQI	26.761	34.385	0.6666666865348816	2	I got the the scheduling service which worked out really worked out really well for me.
qlDT-bmIzQI	62.589	67.78	1.6666666269302368	5	and it was really a very pleasant experience and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.
qlDT-bmIzQI	57.73	63.0	3.0	4	The staff was great all the time helped me with everything I needed.
qlDiE1d45Bc	50.786	58.231	0.0	14	We have to deal with the economics of the two places in the world that can absorb carbon dioxide.
qlDiE1d45Bc	64.435	71.411	-0.6666666865348816	17	And we need to change the language, the way we describe energy sources.
qlDiE1d45Bc	76.019	90.917	1.0	19	These may sound simplistic, but the fact of the matter is that if each individual can make the kind of changes we're talking about and help the collective make the macro arguments that we talked about, the world will be a better place.
qlDiE1d45Bc	70.501	76.759	-0.3333333432674408	18	They're not alternative energy sources, they're sustainable energy sources.
qlDiE1d45Bc	4.421	10.889	0.3333333432674408	2	And the question I want to address is dealing with the economy verse dealing with the environment.
qlDiE1d45Bc	20.126	26.394	0.3333333432674408	5	We can do two less, two less degrees of heat, two less degrees of cooling.
qmx0nQZYHIo	35.231	49.272	-0.3333333432674408	5	The money continues to grow over time in this tax deferred environment and many times progressive employers will match the contributions because they too get benefits from the IRS in doing so.
qmx0nQZYHIo	23.707	35.453	0.6666666865348816	4	This allows the employee to save money usually through payroll deduction from the plan and save that money in a tax deferred environment.
qo2reupzUE0	2.865	12.465	-0.3333333432674408	1	Some of the things that we discussed today with BabyCenter and some of the Google work that's done shows how important or how much mom relies on Search.
qo2reupzUE0	47.523	52.973	0.0	8	We know that moms are-- as we talked earlier-- moms are connecting with more moms.
qo2reupzUE0	25.144	33.837	-1.6666666269302368	4	And so if we're not ranking on the top three or certainly on the top page, we're pretty much irrelevant to that mom at that point in time.
qo2reupzUE0	40.429	45.6	0.3333333432674408	6	So online and Search are absolutely critical for the baby care category.
qpht9L3s9G4	61.671	70.134	0.0	8	The other step that is very important is to get a very thorough audiologic assessment completed and that would need to be known by an audiologist.
qpht9L3s9G4	23.807	31.741	0.6666666865348816	3	Another sign is that you need to request repetition more frequently than others, particularly in back ground noise.
qrI7XCKRFNk	6.397	14.67	0.3333333432674408	1	For instance some act as “world moderators”, which is to say, the diplomatic mediator in international disputes
qrI7XCKRFNk	0.0	7.397	-0.3333333432674408	0	Beyond this, the job actually has few official duties and as a result, every Secretary General has interpreted it differently
qrI7XCKRFNk	21.323	31.931	0.0	3	One example of a “moderator”-type was Secretary General Kofi Annan, who prioritized human rights and the spread of HIV while in office from 1997 to 2006
qrI7XCKRFNk	13.67	22.323	0.0	2	In fact when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was creating the UN, this is how he envisioned the Secretary General’s role
qrI7XCKRFNk	41.796	48.154	-0.3333333432674408	5	Not only is the job of the Secretary General open to interpretation, but so is the appointment process
qrI7XCKRFNk	31.759	42.796	0.0	4	By comparison, Annan’s successor, Ban Ki Moon, has been more of an administrator-type, overseeing the UN but with little input about what its moral obligations should be
qrSW93EtuMc	0.0	9.672	0.6666666865348816	0	A new survey released yesterday by KPMG International, titled Navigating APAs, shows that respondents believe the benefits of an APA outweigh the costs.
qrSW93EtuMc	27.13	36.87	1.6666666269302368	3	According to the survey, with more control over the timing of the APA process compared to an audit, respondents were better able to manage their workflows and internal resources.
qszy_WSRFUM	96.143	101.254	1.3333333730697632	10	Being able to manipulate the image this way can make a good shot even better.
qszy_WSRFUM	7.554	20.407	0.6666666865348816	1	So let's say you are in the process of editing and you find a spot that you really like but you wish the camera have zoomed in just a little bit or maybe it is rotated to the right a little too far and you want to fix it.
qszy_WSRFUM	0.0	7.636	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi this Shana Bethune on behalf of Expert Village and I'm going to talk to you about image manipulation in final cut pro.
qszy_WSRFUM	45.887	57.263	-1.0	5	Now I grab on to the corners here and pull it out to make it bigger and once I have it at the size that I want I can move it around like this.
qszy_WSRFUM	40.36	45.58	0.0	4	So I can see the image and this frame around it to let me know how big it is.
qszy_WSRFUM	78.224	95.157	1.0	9	Again I go up to the corner and I move my cursor so it makes this little circular icon, grab on and now I can twist it until it is at the angle that I want.
qszy_WSRFUM	70.671	78.326	0.3333333432674408	8	Now let's say that I have it the size that I want but I want to rotate it a little bit cause I feel that it is not quiet at the right angle.
qtI3CB1jslQ	66.361	81.039	0.3333333432674408	8	And the third piece is really just measurement and optimization, is connecting those dots, Once all of those three things are lined up you have a incredible marketing force with purpose that's connected to real math.
qvIhzmujTi8	54.807	59.728	0.0	10	Make sure that not one person sits there and does not participate at all.
qvIhzmujTi8	25.932	32.151	-0.6666666865348816	4	In our book group, the rule is we're going to have spoilers.
qvIhzmujTi8	71.659	83.324	0.0	14	I know sometimes it's very interesting and sometimes it's enlightening to do that, but keep your discussion on the book, and leave time at the end for discussing things that don't have anything to do with the book.
qyJiDgtj6YE	50.177	58.341	-0.3333333432674408	10	They do get a special venue because they were the lobbyists, they were the ones who put up those special dollars.
qyJiDgtj6YE	76.667	81.259	0.3333333432674408	13	I want the opinions of the people, not the special interests.
qyJiDgtj6YE	72.327	77.418	0.0	12	I would say to them, look, I know you have an opinion, but you're paid to have that opinion.
qyJiDgtj6YE	87.702	97.412	-0.6666666865348816	17	honestly this is kind of interesting, Wal-Mart went down to Mexico here a few years ago and they said, we want to build a new Wal-Mart and the people around there said, well gee, that's where our ancestors are buried.
qyJiDgtj6YE	21.073	24.348	0.0	3	Henderson: So as president what would you do to change that?
qyJiDgtj6YE	23.847	31.123	1.0	4	Schweitzer: Well, to start with, if you look at my record in Montana, I was elected without taking a penny of special interest money.
qyJiDgtj6YE	32.697	37.01	0.0	6	I didn't demand at the other side, I didn't even challenge them not to.

r4ul1wl_1T8	84.589	94.519	0.0	11	And what was happening was the biggest traditional advertising spending brand was getting no sales lift.
r4ul1wl_1T8	94.706	100.415	0.6666666865348816	12	And the lowest spending traditional advertising spending brand was getting great sale lifts.
r4ul1wl_1T8	103.795	115.501	-0.3333333432674408	15	But the much lower level of advertising done by the low spending brand was getting consumers to integrate the brand into their conversation.
r4ul1wl_1T8	14.149	30.085	0.3333333432674408	5	What Crispin Porter does, and I love this way of thinking, is they create advertising that will become part of the conversation.
r4ul1wl_1T8	29.854	49.671	0.3333333432674408	6	And where many marketers don't like the idea that consumers are messing with their brand, so to speak, Crispin Porter views it as a big plus if you can get consumers engaged enough with your brand to start messing with.
r4ul1wl_1T8	72.257	81.848	0.0	9	And in fact, there's a great case history, this company called Symphony that is good at this listening stuff.
r8OPmbZZlpE	11.775	20.956	1.3333333730697632	1	It has the potential to transform the way organizations control risks and manage their businesses right across the global insurance industry.
r8OPmbZZlpE	27.968	36.77	1.0	3	All respondents surveyed in Europe are using EC modeling, while North American and South African insurers are adopting it to some extent.
r8OPmbZZlpE	20.525	28.13	0.3333333432674408	2	However, a survey of the world's top insurers shows that a lack of understanding at the very top could hinder its effectiveness.
r917wP1qsL4	90.935	96.484	0.0	18	And where people have been willing to buy has really moved a lot towards the right.
r917wP1qsL4	98.547	105.165	0.6666666865348816	21	They are willing to buy stuff that's got more of a nondigital component.
r917wP1qsL4	44.271	49.072	0.3333333432674408	6	So it's almost a little bit like the old P&amp;G branding strategy.

tgrxA3CiBv0	99.795	108.766	0.3333333432674408	16	So it's important that you create the hairline that's appropriate for the ethnic patient that you're dealing with.

tgrxA3CiBv0	41.876	47.705	0.0	7	Also, when you're transplanting them and putting them in, you have to keep in mind that they can curl a little bit easier.
tgrxA3CiBv0	36.778	42.327	0.6666666865348816	6	So it's important when you're cutting the graft that you're very careful at how you do that.

tv8IhQZQuJI	47.064	63.759	0.0	6	If you were to draw down a $500,000 home loan  – and when I say $500,000, I mean in Aussie dollars, because the purchase price of the property is going to be in Australian dollars, for this example $715,000 – the lender will convert to the foreign currency that you wish.
tv8IhQZQuJI	76.098	84.112	0.0	9	That’s obviously one of the reasons why we get asked a lot of questions about foreign currency loans for Australian Expats and Foreign Investors.
tv8IhQZQuJI	67.358	77.098	1.0	8	Now, obviously the pro’s about it is that you’re going to get a very cheap rate compared to the Australian home loan interest rate at a fraction of the cost.

uYzZB4ccG1Q	197.163	202.364	1.6666666269302368	27	 I will read through them personally and see if I can contribute back in any positive way
uYzZB4ccG1Q	136.431	144.036	1.6666666269302368	20	 First and foremost, be willing to seek out the best in the world and work with those people
uYzZB4ccG1Q	143.036	164.061	1.6666666269302368	21	 Again, whether they are on your team, whether they're mentors, or whether it's a group of people, seek out the best and invest at that particular level because that not only demonstrates how willing you are to get the help that you need, but, by working with the best, it also insures that you get much better results
uYzZB4ccG1Q	163.31	168.141	1.3333333730697632	22	 The second thing that you must do is invest in what you need
uYzZB4ccG1Q	167.72	186.121	2.3333332538604736	23	" Like, be willing to say: ""I can't do this alone; I don't have all the answers; I need more support"" and begin allowing your own investment to circulate out because not only on the energetic level does that shift things but, again, having that help gets you better results"

uYzZB4ccG1Q	23.199	41.18	0.0	3	 Now, if you're having lots of dialogues lately with entrepreneurs that are striving to grow their business and what we see over and over again is this fundamental thing that's preventing you, let's say, from making more money and growing your business
uYzZB4ccG1Q	18.08	23.79	1.3333333730697632	2	 This is all about how you can reach more people and thrive financially
uYzZB4ccG1Q	42.495	45.311	0.3333333432674408	5	 First, let's start with some context
uYzZB4ccG1Q	40.689	42.717	0.6666666865348816	4	 So here's what it is
uYzZB4ccG1Q	44.311	59.868	1.3333333730697632	6	 So, on one side of the equation you want people to value what you do for them to buy your services, to compensate you well for them, to be hungry for it, and also to really see the value of it
uYzZB4ccG1Q	77.256	80.501	-0.3333333432674408	9	 Now, here's the correlation that most people don't see
uYzZB4ccG1Q	61.681	78.256	0.3333333432674408	8	 On the other side, you have means that you need to invest in whether it's staff or mentors or technology or something else that you need in your life specifically to help you, let's say in this case, grow your business
uYzZB4ccG1Q	85.487	87.914	0.0	11	 They ask for favors
uYzZB4ccG1Q	79.8	86.417	0.6666666865348816	10	 Most of the time, when it comes to you investing in what you need, people look for deals
uYzZB4ccG1Q	91.454	96.644	0.0	13	 They just avoid working with the best people in the world
uYzZB4ccG1Q	87.173	92.054	-1.3333333730697632	12	 They haggle around the price; they say things are too expensive
uYzZB4ccG1Q	99.036	102.65	0.0	15	 Now here's where this starts to connect the dots
uYzZB4ccG1Q	95.644	99.777	0.6666666865348816	14	 They avoid investing at the highest possible level
uYzZB4ccG1Q	106.4	109.764	0.6666666865348816	17	 You're wanting them to invest at the highest level
uYzZB4ccG1Q	102.419	106.951	0.0	16	 On the other side, you're wanting people to do that with you
uYzZB4ccG1Q	112.605	136.813	-0.3333333432674408	19	" So, all of a sudden, there's a fundamental disconnect; a misalignment at the core of everything you are doing and that's often why people wonder: ""Why aren't people investing in a way that I want them to?"" So, here's two things you can do to change this dynamic not only so that it shifts energetically but so that you really become the kind of person that's walking your talk"
uYzZB4ccG1Q	109.034	112.717	0.3333333432674408	18	" You're wanting them to value your work and just say ""yes"""

wRKVNiABc0w	85.108	92.024	-0.3333333432674408	14	What does that mean in terms of what will your lifestyle need to be when you graduate.

wRKVNiABc0w	112.625	120.061	-0.3333333432674408	19	Taking out a loan because you want to do a really fun spring break probably isn't a good idea.
wRKVNiABc0w	106.699	113.137	0.0	18	So it means taking out loans for reasons that will keep you in school.
wRKVNiABc0w	147.496	158.843	-0.6666666865348816	23	"It's a scary amount when you're a low income student, and think ""Oh my gosh $20,000 in debt,"" but that's why it's also really critical for you to pick a school that really is going to help you be successful and graduate."
wRKVNiABc0w	3.454	8.454	-0.6666666865348816	1	The average for a student going to a public school is about $26,000 of debt.
wRKVNiABc0w	0.0	4.084	-1.0	0	- The great majority of students have debt when they graduate from college.
wRKVNiABc0w	10.837	19.08	0.0	3	- Taking out loans to pay for your education is a highly, highly, personal decision making process.
wRKVNiABc0w	31.061	42.098	-1.0	5	And sometimes the pressure is to take out loans because no one has money right now, or in other times it's we're not taking out any loans because we have no money to pay it back.
wRKVNiABc0w	158.122	173.579	1.3333333730697632	24	Taking out loan also helps you build up credit, which is a good thing, and get a credit score, but in general, again, most students are going to have loan and they need to kind of think about the school they're going to go to to pay back that loan, but also again it's an investment in themselves.
wRKVNiABc0w	41.248	46.298	0.0	6	Which might mean that if you're not going to take out loans, you need to pay everything right now.
wRKVNiABc0w	50.995	58.83	0.0	8	And so my biggest advice is to think very practically about can you actually pay back those loans?
wRKVNiABc0w	129.118	145.453	0.6666666865348816	21	Yes it's debt, but it's also an investment and if you realize that a student with a college degree makes a million more dollars over the span of their lifetime than a student with a high school degree, $26,000 of debt to a return of over a million extra dollars is a pretty good investment in yourself.

xnNZyfhusAk	6.437	12.515	0.3333333432674408	2	That was really no decision at all for me, I think I was maybe born a democrat.
xnNZyfhusAk	68.166	100.096	0.3333333432674408	7	And what that means to me is that we're all in this together, and what we do as a society and as a community we need to look at how that affects everybody, not just the winners or the people who already have, we need to look at the have nots and we also need to look at the fact that paying our taxes and having a government that supports and protects all of us is good for everyone.
xnNZyfhusAk	48.222	68.488	1.0	6	One of the key values to me that has always driven, what I like to think has driven what I do, is working for the common good, and that to me really is a definition of a democrat, and differentiates democrats from other political parties, or particularly from republicans.

xomMHflvVDw	6.816	18.661	0.0	1	 - Citizens National Bank has always offered Farm Service Agency guaranteed lending, but recently we became a preferred lender with them, which allows us to speed up the approval process

xomMHflvVDw	24.615	29.546	0.0	3	 What we're required to submit now is a one page application and a narrative
xomMHflvVDw	17.661	24.977	0.0	2	 Prior to that, it took us thirty days for an approval through the FSA, but now we can do it in four days
xomMHflvVDw	33.186	38.805	0.6666666865348816	5	 Three years of tax returns, so we can kind of average out what the income numbers are
xomMHflvVDw	29.025	33.358	0.0	4	 If we can get two or three years of annual statements, that would be great
xomMHflvVDw	50.497	66.522	1.0	7	 The benefit to the borrower also allows us on the real estate transactions to offer them a long term real estate loan that's fixed on the rate, different terms that we have now, we can fix a rate up to thirty years
xomMHflvVDw	38.424	50.589	0.0	6	 And the different types of loans that we can offer with this are Farm Ownership loans, Operating lines of credit, or Equipment and Capital Improvement needs loans
xomMHflvVDw	70.411	82.636	0.0	9	 You know the benefit to that would be that they can mitigate any interest rate risk by locking in and knowing where their payments will be for ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five years up to thirty
xomMHflvVDw	65.961	70.863	0.0	8	 Where prior to that, typically, we'd lock a rate in for a borrower for five years

xomMHflvVDw	82.215	92.863	0.0	10	 Other than the Farm Service Agency loan programs, other options that we have started or are involved with would be through the Farmer Mac Program

xomMHflvVDw	93.599	101.064	0.3333333432674408	12	 There's a Farmer Mac Two which coincides with the Farm Service Agency, that'll give us a fixed rate on their program
xomMHflvVDw	119.47	125.049	0.3333333432674408	15	 Another option that we have through the Farm Service Agency is the Beginning Farmer program
xomMHflvVDw	102.289	119.722	0.0	14	 And the Farmer Mac One is available to any borrower and even if you are a investor owning property and you want to have an option of having a fixed rate on your real estate, we can take you through the Farmer Mac One program and lock that rate in
xomMHflvVDw	132.121	139.467	0.0	17	 The way this works or the structure would be that the bank would finance 50% of the deal on our normal terms
xomMHflvVDw	124.329	132.343	0.0	16	 And this really allows for a family farm operation to transition real estate from one generation to the next

xu53lk4dhSc	72.207	77.887	-1.0	14	There was a cooked-up news story that was about fundraising complaints on the rise.

xwNQ7QuXaps	163.769	189.513	0.6666666865348816	10	And then also in the implementation, in our case, we were taking a very large lecture and breaking it into a lot of smaller more Internet classroom experiences and that means there is more time spent for us at this point then there used to be in face-to-face teaching, but the payoff is that we had much higher quality teaching, and the students were really getting along more out of this.
xwNQ7QuXaps	53.081	71.461	1.3333333730697632	5	I mean, the attendance was so much better throughout the year, and in fact because the attendance was higher and we were asking students to go to twice as many classes, what we found was that over the year students had attended something like three times more classes, of this small problem classes, than they used to.
xwNQ7QuXaps	46.226	53.811	1.0	4	But even if you don't believe the exam data that we had, we saw the engagement significantly improved.
xwNQ7QuXaps	85.018	117.586	0.6666666865348816	7	Introducing a flipped classroom into our course for mathematics for engineering students has been very positive, this has taught me and many of the other teaching staff here a lot about how to introduce new components into our teaching, and it's given us hands-on experience with things like using videos for lecture contents, as well as using an online testing system.
xwNQ7QuXaps	138.098	164.52	-0.6666666865348816	9	It's also clear that setting up a flipped classroom method really does take a lot of effort, it took a lot of our time in the design phase and then in the sort of post-design pre-implementation phase, where we designing the specifics of the videos and the classroom material and writing the online tests.
