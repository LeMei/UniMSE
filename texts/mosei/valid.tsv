102858	17.342	22.283	0.3333333432674408	3	 I'm talking about Garfield Holiday Celebrations
102858	5.479	18.342	1.6666666269302368	2	 And even though it is only, right now, at least, it is only, you know, July, I'm talking about holidays today, specifically, three of my all-time favorite holiday specials on one disc
102858	43.014	50.279	2.6666667461395264	5	 Honestly, if you are a fan of Garfield in any way, you're going to absolutely adore this thing
102858	21.812	43.295	3.0	4	 This one disc contains not only Garfield, not only Garfield's Halloween, Halloween (stutter) Adventure, a special I've I've (stutter) watched almost every year since I was about four, but it also has Garfield's (stutter) Thanksgiving, which is a pretty funny little short, funny little special, and A Garfield's Christmas, which is just absolutely awesome
102858	55.565	60.356	0.0	7	 Let's see (stutter) now, the Halloween special, a little, I'm going to go about twenty-five years
102858	49.279	56.565	2.6666667461395264	6	 It's probably three of the best (stutter) holiday specials made in the last (uhh) let's see
102858	67.947	69.476	-0.3333333432674408	9	 But still
102858	60.215	68.787	-0.3333333432674408	8	 And that's being really generous, because I know that the I know that the (stutter) Halloween Adventure was made after I was born, and I was born in eighty two
102858	75.25	83.743	-0.6666666865348816	11	 And this and this (stutter) disc, unfortunately, you really aren't going to find it in stores until around October, when everyone starts stocking up on Halloween DVDs
102858	69.823	75.532	2.0	10	 Regardless (umm) all three specials are just awesome
102858	84.759	88.373	0.0	13	 Or I should say, that, that, that (stutter) is when my family picked up this thing
102858	82.763	85.26	0.3333333432674408	12	 In fact, that's when I got this thing
102858	93.12	96.035	0.0	15	 And then, Thanksgiving, I watched it all again
102858	88.001	93.002	0.6666666865348816	14	 And I sat down and I I (stutter) watched the whole thing at once
102858	96.851	99.956	1.0	17	 I watched this thing three times in three months
102858	95.035	97.851	-0.3333333432674408	16	 And then Christmas, I watched it all again
102858	102.728	107.819	0.0	19	 So, yeah, Garfield's Halloween, or Holiday Celebrations
102858	100.493	103.259	0.0	18	 That's saying quite a bit, guys

112433	51.764	64.148	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) I don't know what the movie directors were thinking I guess they decided that by throwing as much fancy computer graphics as they could they would cover up the fact that there was absolutely no plot
112433	36.399	51.297	-1.3333333730697632	4	 Really not I think in order to see this movie, you would have to watch the first two right beforehand to understand it properly because, coming out of that theater after two and a half hours, I still had on idea what was going on
112433	70.581	73.756	-0.6666666865348816	7	 You're really not missing out on anything
112433	65.303	71.152	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) Really, (uhh) unless you're a die hard fan, I would not recommend this one
112433	82.484	89.51	-2.0	9	 I am not going to give away the plot if you do want to see it but (umm) but I was very disappointed
112433	73.953	83.484	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) And in fact, you know a lot of the character development was kinda (uhh) was a little bit angering such as (umm) you know Keira Knightley's development

128059	15.077	26.324	-0.3333333432674408	4	 It's just kind of the big, super slick you know, action blockbuster that's you know, a lot of lot of (stutter) you know, colors, a lot of style but not really much substance behind it
128059	39.611	55.039	0.0	7	 (uhh) You know, if you don't know what it's about (uhh) you know it's a team of scientists that go up into space to explore this kind of radiation field that's going by earth and you know it ends up you know destroying their station and when they get back they all develop super powers you know

130456	2.416	6.19	2.6666667461395264	2	 It's (umm) definitely a cult movie favorite
130456	14.189	19.28	-0.3333333432674408	5	 And He's he's a very weird kid
130456	8.791	14.291	0.0	4	 (umm) It follows this boy Donnie Darko, played by (uhh) Jake Gyllenhaal

130456	33.705	40.931	0.6666666865348816	9	 (umm) I really like how it's done because, if you watch this movie five times you will still not understand everything about it
130456	31.41	34.136	-1.0	8	 (uhh) Not recommended for kids at all
188343	77.815	80.132	1.0	11	 (umm) and so you might enjoy that
188343	63.727	77.966	1.6666666269302368	10	 (uhh) We (uhh) enjoyed seeing the (uhh) the subtitles (uhh) versus the, the (stutter) dubbed voices, dubbed American voices (uhh) and how the dialogue (uhh) differed from the subtitles on the screen
188343	84.459	93.112	1.0	13	 (uhh) But (uhh) like I said it might be (uhh) good for a laugh (umm) if you really like monster movies or if you (uhh) like Japanese films
188343	79.66	84.731	-2.0	12	 (uhh) But all in all it's it's (stutter) not a very good movie and so I would not recommend it

188343	3.952	8.794	0.0	1	 This is actually a Japanese film, it's a monster movie
188343	0.0	4.952	0.0	0	Hi, I'm Bruce and today I'm reviewing The Host which is now out on DVD
188343	20.365	23.211	-1.3333333730697632	3	 Unfortunately it was not
188343	8.113	21.365	0.6666666865348816	2	 It was (uhh) very well (uhh) reviewed on the (uhh) the movie poster (umm) and so I was (uhh) taken in to (uhh) check it out and see if it was a good as the reviewers said
188343	29.973	34.705	0.0	5	 (umm) Where it's about to drop in the water and (uhh) mayhem begins
188343	22.969	30.225	0.0	4	 (umm) What you're watching right now is the scene where (uhh) this monster, this (uhh) sea creature is first found
188343	48.322	51.397	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (uhh) I definitely would not recommend it
188343	34.044	48.184	0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) But basically it's the story of a dysfunctional Japanese family that (uhh) ends up coming together in order to save (uhh) the young girl that is (uhh) taken (uhh) by this (uhh) sea monster
188343	57.201	63.978	1.0	9	 (uhh) But (uhh) if you enjoy seeing foreign films (umm) you might (uhh) have a little fun with it
188343	51.255	57.303	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (uhh) We actually had to skip through some of the movie because it just got so drawn out
1HK7Nea0PFo	14.209	20.916	0.0	1	But now I think our . . . our hardest work is . . . legitimacy.
1HK7Nea0PFo	0.0	14.78	0.3333333432674408	0	Scott Reed talking: I think right now where we are . . . the hardest thing that we face is, having kind of established what the game is, . . . uh, we know we don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel every year and that’s fantastic.
1HK7Nea0PFo	20.615	30.604	0.0	2	Making sure that we don’t just build the engaging game but that we’re articulate about our reasoning and our purpose for wanting to do it.
1HK7Nea0PFo	60.693	73.417	0.6666666865348816	5	I think now going into our fifth iteration of the game our . . . one of our big challenges is making sure we’re articulating that to everybody else, make sure that they understand that there’s value, hopefully, in what we’re doing.
216097	6.048	13.034	-1.0	1	 (umm) There are really no known actors are in this movie
216097	0.0	5.032	0.0	0	Hi, I'm here to review the movie When Worlds Collide
216097	20.605	31.382	0.6666666865348816	3	 In it, an astronomer discovers a planet and it's moon are in a direct collision course (uhh) with the earth
216097	13.561	20.766	0.0	2	 (umm) It's directed by George Pal who did many other (uhh) science fiction movies during the fifties
216097	46.526	58.012	-0.3333333432674408	5	 So he goes to private invest investors (stutter) and a few millionaires (uhh) decide yes (uhh) the human population is worth saving
216097	31.36	46.259	0.0	4	 He goes to the world governments who think he's a crackpot and really have no interest in building a rocket ship to try to (uhh) save a few people kind of like a Noah's arc to another planet
216097	59.706	86.936	-0.3333333432674408	7	 He's able to save forty people (uhh) on his rocket ship, which I found pretty interesting since he has thousands working for him to build his rocket ship and most of them know that hey, the only chance is for forty people getting out so why am I wasting all this time and energy to helping forty people get away when the astronomer, his daughter and her two boyfriends are already guaranteed four of the forty spots on the rocket ship
216097	57.012	59.997	0.3333333432674408	6	 So they give all their money to him
216097	86.724	90.388	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (umm) The special effects aren't all that good
223431	60.474	67.61	-1.3333333730697632	11	 Don't expect much in in (stutter) acting or anything like that, it's pretty much just classic Alien Versus Predators
223431	56.882	60.536	-1.0	10	 (umm) Definitely gets tireless after a while {laugh}
223431	71.339	76.57	-2.3333332538604736	13	 (uhh) I don't think you should go see this in theater or even pay matinee for this
223431	68.326	71.99	-0.6666666865348816	12	 (umm) I would recommend waiting for a movie
223431	75.57	79.573	-0.3333333432674408	14	 Just wait for a movie to come out and enjoy it then
223431	3.034	8.095	0.0	1	 I'm here to review Alien Versus Predator: Requiem
223431	1.658	4.034	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello expo
223431	18.19	21.575	0.6666666865348816	3	 (uhh) The movie was a classic Alien Versus Predator
223431	8.642	17.574	-1.3333333730697632	2	 (uhh) I went to this movie and I was greatly disappointed but maybe I shouldn't have been at this point cause I shouldn't have expected much from it
223431	28.327	36.241	0.0	5	 Crashes on earth in a small town and aliens get loose and start killing all the inhabitants
223431	22.031	28.828	0.0	4	 (uhh) It's pretty much the story of (uhh) a ship crashing, a predator ship crashing, from the (uhh) last one
223431	43.203	49.89	-0.6666666865348816	7	 (uhh) So I mean if that's what you're after, if you're all after is is (stutter) a Predator killing aliens then fine
223431	35.96	42.816	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (uhh) So a Predator has to come and save and hunt these aliens
223431	52.273	56.216	-2.0	9	 So you didn't get to see a bunch of different cool things like in the others
223431	48.89	53.273	-2.0	8	 The bad part is there's only one Predator, which kind of sucks
225770	87.792	97.213	0.3333333432674408	11	 (umm) There are some haunting special features on this one (umm) some commentary, some deleted scenes (umm) and some other featurettes
225770	81.167	88.133	-1.6666666269302368	10	 You do feel like she's being tormented (umm) but there just was not enough of it to support the movie
225770	101.161	104.127	-2.0	13	 It's gonna get a one out of five from me
225770	97.4	102.161	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (umm) If I had to rate this one I would say probably leave it alone
225770	104.943	111.051	-1.0	14	 (umm) Just not enough of the actual exorcism (umm) to make it worth viewing
225770	6.137	10.39	0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) This movie is supposed to be based on a true story
225770	0.0	6.04	0.0	0	Hello, today I'm reviewing The Exorcism of Emily Rose (uhh) starring Laura Linney
225770	19.138	37.149	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (umm) I expected something more along the lines of an The (stutter) Exorcist (umm) where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the exorcism and going through it step by step like that and that just doesn't happen in this movie
225770	11.196	18.99	-1.0	2	 (umm) The previews for it looked really really really good, (umm) but it was not quite what I expected
225770	44.869	49.332	-0.3333333432674408	5	 And it starts at his trial
225770	36.548	45.63	0.0	4	 (umm) This is actually told (uhh) from the point of view of a priest who (umm) performed the exorcism on Emily Rose
225770	59.915	67.969	2.0	7	 (umm) The parts where you actually get to see her and what she's going through (umm) with demons possessing her are great
225770	48.332	60.177	0.0	6	 He's on trial for (umm) completing that exorcism and the only time you get to see Emily Rose is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling
225770	77.894	82.167	1.3333333730697632	9	 The girl in this movie did a really really good job
225770	67.907	78.894	1.0	8	 (umm) If the whole movie would've been like that this definitely would've been, you know, one of my top movies of all-time because the part where it's focusing on her is well acted
236021	75.4	78.016	0.6666666865348816	11	 So, that's Fred Claus
236021	70.361	76.36	-1.0	10	 But (umm) not my type of Christmas movie
236021	77.306	80.221	1.3333333730697632	12	 (uhh) Go check it out, if you want
236021	6.217	13.842	0.3333333432674408	1	 (umm) It's currently out in theaters and it's about this guy named Fred and he is Santa Claus's brother
236021	0.77	5.641	0.0	0	Hi, I'm Valerie and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Fred Claus
236021	28.437	32.709	0.0	3	 He thinks the whole situation is silly
236021	13.541	29.437	0.0	2	 And it's around the holiday times when everyone's getting ready for Christmas and they're getting all their toys set and (umm) so they have their little family get togethers and (umm) Fred doesn't really get along with anybody really
236021	53.819	57.094	-0.6666666865348816	5	 It's (uhh) it's kind of a kid movie
236021	31.709	54.819	0.6666666865348816	4	 So he kind of (uhh) steps in one day and looks after things at the North Pole and then it turns into this big party and everything goes kind of crazy havocy and so, Santa Claus's brother doesn't really like that too much and so I don't know
236021	58.498	62.322	-1.3333333730697632	7	 I would rate it a two out of five
236021	56.453	59.419	-1.3333333730697632	6	 I personally didn't really like it
236021	66.171	71.042	-0.3333333432674408	9	 But if you're a really young kid you may find it entertaining and nice
236021	62.908	67.131	-2.0	8	 (umm) It seemed like he was just trying too hard I guess
237009	54.019	56.645	-3.0	11	 (umm), it should be rated junk
237009	51.235	53.602	0.0	10	 Eighty-three minutes long
237009	57.231	67.959	-2.6666667461395264	12	 (umm), so if (uhh) you really want to (umm) yeah, don't don't (stutter) waste your time, it's it's (stutter) really terrible
237009	1.947	7.816	0.0	1	 This is my review on the movie National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation Two
237009	0.0	2.797	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi Expo, this is Nikki
237009	12.403	15.389	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) I think they were reaching for this one
237009	8.462	11.847	-1.0	2	 (uhh) definitely not as good as the first
237009	20.824	31.911	-3.0	5	 (umm), I think they thought that they could probably put another one together and (umm) my personal opinion, I think they failed miserably, but, you know, again,that's my opinion
237009	15.356	20.607	0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm), I think since they had (umm) such a good one the first time
237009	37.087	39.993	-3.0	7	 (umm) I was just greatly disappointed
237009	31.3	36.122	-2.6666667461395264	6	 (umm) I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, really
237009	46.805	52.045	0.0	9	 (umm) it's (uhh) not rated
237009	38.993	46.418	-0.6666666865348816	8	 Randy Quaid xxx yeah, {laugh} there's some funny things that he does, but he did those things in the first one
241629	80.409	86.088	-1.6666666269302368	10	 So overall I would not recommend seeing this movie I would give it two out of five stars

241629	36.498	44.004	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) She's been in twenty-seven different weddings and has twenty-seven hideous bridesmaid dresses to prove it
241629	27.489	36.77	0.0	4	 (uhh) It's about (uhh) a girl who's kind of proverbially always a bridesmaid never the bride, (uhh) hence the name of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses
241629	52.482	56.924	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) I I (stutter) was pretty disappointed with with (stutter) it overall
241629	44.869	52.514	-2.0	6	 (umm) It's just kind of one of those predictable movies that (uhh) I don't think I would recommend going to see
241629	69.005	80.83	0.3333333432674408	9	 (uhh) You know Katherine Heigl does (uhh) a a (stutter) good job and she is kind of settling into a comedic role, (uhh) so she does a good job acting it's no, not (stutter) a problem with the acting it's more a problem with the story
241629	56.683	69.146	-0.3333333432674408	8	 (uhh) It's just you know, I had a few laughs and that sort of thing but nothing you know just, compared to Knocked Up which was just absolutely fall on the floor laughs I didn't think it was nearly as good
243646	114.042	118.494	-0.6666666865348816	11	 Like, like (stutter) I am saying, you know, I don't know
243646	58.498	115.042	-2.6666667461395264	10	 But, (umm) what I wanted to say about this movie is that I am going to give it a one out of five stars just because if you have any morals what so ever, you won't watch this movie just because one, it's very crude (umm) so much unnecessary stuff goes on, (umm) seems like there's always sexting or something inappropriate so I don't recommend it for kids and two, it promotes like saying like it's okay to (umm) divorce and just you know garbage like that (umm) which you know there's so much divorce already and in, you know, United States, why do we need a movie saying it's okay so basically what happens he meets this girl and they get married and they go on their honey moon and then he starts hanging out with another girl but I'm not going to ruin it but, yeah
243646	117.824	139.816	-1.3333333730697632	12	 I just, I didn't (stutter) think the movie was that good and (umm) without ruining anything just I mean, think about your morals {laughs} so that's my (uhh) opinion on this and what will he do you know Is he going to be a man What's he going to do But Alright this is The Heartbreak Kid
243646	1.069	8.325	0.3333333432674408	1	 Today I wanted to do a review on the movie, The Heartbreak Kid
243646	0.56	1.889	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
243646	10.577	13.433	0.0	3	 Let me just show you a little clip first
243646	10.078	11.537	0.0	2	 (umm) Yeah
243646	30.522	52.285	0.0	7	 That clip right there was (uhh) {cough} (uhh) this guy you know he's (umm) had some girlfriends but he's kind of afraid of commitment and (umm) he, for some reason, he is kinda good friends with some of his previous and he was at a wedding of one of his girlfriend's, previous girlfriend's, wedding
243646	29.095	30.973	0.3333333432674408	6	894} Alright
243646	56.453	57.902	0.0	9	 Case
243646	52.522	55.088	0.0	8	 (umm) There's the movie as you can see
247318	61.591	66.902	0.3333333432674408	11	 (umm) Perhaps you know, (stutters) two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes
247318	59.017	61.634	-2.0	10	 I give it two out of five stars
247318	69.054	73.227	-1.6666666269302368	13	 It was it was all in all a bad movie
247318	67.618	70.054	-2.0	12	 (umm) It just didn't do it for me though
247318	72.227	74.135	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I would not recommend it
247318	2.845	8.534	0.0	1	 Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie
247318	0.0	3.845	0.0	0	Hello Expo TV
247318	13.71	16.766	-2.3333332538604736	3	 B here standing for bad
247318	9.24	14.71	-1.6666666269302368	2	 (uhh) In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie
247318	32.318	37.508	-0.3333333432674408	5	 It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that
247318	17.681	31.642	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) In some ways I look at this movie as (umm) an attempt, I don't know by either (stutter) the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on it's feet or something it didn't really
247318	37.805	40.023	-2.0	7	 It wasn't very funny
247318	36.508	38.516	-0.3333333432674408	6	 It was a kids movie
247318	42.445	60.017	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) It really didn't (uhh) add anything and give anything know to you know (umm) cinematography (stutter) (umm) It's basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie (umm) and I really do think that
247318	39.452	42.008	-1.3333333730697632	8	 It wasn't very entertaining
252998	3.663	11.208	0.0	1	 Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, (umm) Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior
252998	0.0	4.064	0.0	0	Hi, I'm here to review the movie The House of Yes
252998	20.684	27.022	0.3333333432674408	3	 (umm) Josh Hamilton plays the son, he's bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time
252998	11.435	20.387	0.0	2	 (umm) This was a movie about an eccentric rich family living in Massachussetts who are (umm) obsessed by the Kennedys
252998	49.269	63.429	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (uhh) The movie is billed as a dark comedy but (uhh) I didn't really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and (uhh) maybe bizarre
252998	28.227	49.511	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but it's his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie
252998	64.984	75.013	1.3333333730697632	7	 (uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no you're not insane you're just incredibly spoiled
252998	62.429	65.395	-2.0	6	 If if (stutter) that's a good word
252998	75.29	78.246	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (uhh) The House of Yes a rounding no
257247	85.268	87.794	-1.0	11	 (umm) There, it just wasn't my cup of tea
257247	82.883	85.08	-0.3333333432674408	10	 Some of it's kind of bad
257247	87.263	93.112	-1.6666666269302368	12	 Wasn't well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldn't recommend watching it
257247	0.77	7.676	0.0	1	 It's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review ten thousand BC, (uhh) which recently came out in theaters
257247	0.0	1.7	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey, y'all
257247	11.395	22.273	-1.6666666269302368	3	 And (uhh) while I found those films (uhh), particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good, (umm) (uhh) ten thousand BC fails in that department
257247	7.005	11.817	0.0	2	 It's (uhh) from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow
257247	44.111	48.773	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) I thought the ending especially was, (uhh) was pretty horrible
257247	21.941	43.734	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) It's about basically a, a (stutter) tribe of people who, (uhh) you know, like someone who (uhh) one, one (stutter) person gets (uhh) like a princess kind of deal happens where (uhh) she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens
257247	66.869	80.281	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (umm) It's, (uhh) it's been getting (uhh) pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, (uhh) particularly because I liked Independence Day and (uhh) unfortunately it failed
257247	48.541	65.465	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (uhh) I don't want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, let's just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh) (uhh) just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing
257247	82.155	83.883	0.0	9	 Some of it's good
257247	79.78	82.945	0.0	8	 The CGI, (uhh) there was a lot of CGI
258654	15.376	31.881	-1.3333333730697632	1	 It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do crazy dumb things and (uhh) basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick (uhh) all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie he's ever made
258654	0.869	16.376	1.3333333730697632	0	Hello, today I'm going to review Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie that's basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics (uhh) he's playing a basketball player this time and that's basically all the plot there is to it
258654	44.74	59.778	-2.3333332538604736	3	 This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be (uhh) apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising (uhh) this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl
258654	30.881	45.74	-2.0	2	 This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and (uhh) speaking of Saturday Night Live movies it's just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man
258654	63.188	75.033	-1.6666666269302368	5	 You really couldn't get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better
258654	59.027	63.928	0.0	4	 They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition
266791	159.0	163.652	-1.6666666269302368	24	 And it doesn't help that the words they're delivering are just dumb
266791	165.635	169.818	-1.3333333730697632	25	 (umm) I almost walked out of the movie, but I wanted to stay till the end
266791	168.818	172.162	0.0	26	 I wanted to see how it wrapped up
266791	173.677	186.979	-1.3333333730697632	27	 (umm) The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, it's towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker
266791	117.694	128.332	0.6666666865348816	20	 (uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm) Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, they're all decent actors in his movies
266791	128.739	145.144	-1.6666666269302368	21	 (umm) I don't know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor I don't know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves
266791	144.842	152.597	-1.6666666269302368	22	 So, I don't know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script
266791	152.365	159.541	-2.6666667461395264	23	 As you're watching the movie it looks like they're actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, that's how the delivery is
266791	186.887	204.14	-2.6666667461395264	28	 And, from there, it just went downhill and it went really over the top when (uhh) they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her iPhone, which is horrible product placement, and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit
266791	203.748	205.876	-1.6666666269302368	29	 Obviously CG
266791	0.141	2.887	0.0	1	 Today I'm reviewing the movie, The Happening
266791	0.0	1.141	0.0	0	Hi
266791	6.666	12.116	1.0	3	 Night Shyamalan, who previously directed the good movies Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs
266791	2.945	7.427	0.0	2	 (umm) The Happening is the latest movie from writer director M
266791	15.756	24.308	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (umm) Unfortunately, this one can't even fit into the not so good movies category (umm) I'll get to that in a little bit
266791	11.894	15.778	-1.6666666269302368	4	 And the not so good movies The Village and Lady in the Water
266791	34.323	42.557	-0.3333333432674408	7	 And something happens at the beginning of the movie and, for some reason, people start talking funny and killing themselves
266791	24.266	35.323	0.0	6	 (umm) The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his wife (umm) and also stars John Leguizamo as his friend
266791	47.693	54.53	-1.3333333730697632	9	 (umm) There are theories that are thrown about and the big theory is pretty silly
266791	43.632	47.995	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) The cause of this is never fully explained
266791	60.494	64.497	1.0	11	 (umm) It was probably a good idea when M
266791	54.757	59.927	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (umm) {clears throat} My problem with this movie isn't so much the plot
266791	72.257	74.584	-0.6666666865348816	13	 They run away from the wind
266791	63.497	73.127	-1.3333333730697632	12	 Night Shyamalan created it, when he thought of it, (umm) but unfortunately, most of the time, the actors actually find themselves walking or running, rather, away from the wind
266791	81.157	86.936	-2.6666667461395264	15	 (umm) The problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious
266791	74.562	79.842	-1.3333333730697632	14	 (umm) If that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out, but otherwise, don't bother
266791	91.414	105.923	-2.3333332538604736	17	 (umm) The Village and Lady in the Water were sub-par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally, but they were at least well made films (uhh) this I'm surprised this movie actually got any kind of release, any kind of distribution
266791	86.445	90.947	-2.6666667461395264	16	 (uhh) That's probably the best word I can use to describe this movie is just atrocious
266791	108.924	117.995	-0.3333333432674408	19	 (umm) Dialogue's never really been his strong suit, but he usually casts decent enough actors or, at least, gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it
266791	104.923	107.579	-2.6666667461395264	18	 The dialogue is horrible
266791	205.295	207.911	-2.6666667461395264	31	 Just terribly done
266791	204.876	206.155	-2.3333332538604736	30	 Bad CG
266791	216.499	222.877	-2.6666667461395264	36	 (uhh) This is the kind of movie that's gonna to be ridiculed in five years on DVD by drunken Frat boys because it's just that awful
266791	213.247	216.871	-2.6666667461395264	35	 I don't recommend anybody ever seeing this
266791	210.882	214.247	-2.3333332538604736	34	 I'm only gonna give this one one out of five stars
266791	209.725	211.882	-2.3333332538604736	33	 It's just an awful movie
266791	206.911	210.026	-1.0	32	 Terribly delivered dialogue while they're watching it
270254	121.505	124.461	-1.3333333730697632	24	 (stutter) Don't know, it's more up to you
270254	123.461	128.332	-0.6666666865348816	25	 I'm going to give this a two out five, hope it helps
270254	97.49	99.188	-1.0	20	 Okay
270254	99.196	101.144	1.3333333730697632	21	 This was funny
270254	101.102	116.409	-1.6666666269302368	22	" Why am I spending my money watching this?"" {sigh} I think I was more sad that I spent the money to watch this but (umm) otherwise it is funny enough to watch it, but not funny enough to watch it in theaters"
270254	115.449	119.981	-1.6666666269302368	23	 Wait to rent it if you're really desperate, buy it if you want to
270254	3.883	8.943	1.3333333730697632	1	 As always, bam, movie ticket, right there
270254	0.0	4.883	0.0	0	Hey everybody, this is Tom and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hancock
270254	10.837	12.924	0.3333333432674408	3	 Alright, Hancock
270254	9.799	11.208	0.0	2	 Out of the way
270254	19.587	23.959	0.0	5	 Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight
270254	11.924	20.158	-1.6666666269302368	4	 It is a Will Smith attempt at making a superhero movie in a summer of really good superhero movies
270254	30.163	32.879	-2.6666667461395264	7	 Hancock is not good
270254	23.847	30.913	0.6666666865348816	6	 Okay, as you can tell I'm doing this a little bit past the point when Hancock came out, but you see where I'm going with this
270254	38.763	45.75	1.3333333730697632	9	 Okay, it had its funny points because it's about a bum on the streets who has superhuman abilities
270254	32.408	39.145	-1.3333333730697632	8	 One, no one has ever heard of this, two, I hope nobody will remember this cause this was a bad movie
270254	58.568	61.095	0.0	11	 That is the story of this
270254	45.209	58.65	-0.6666666865348816	10	 And eventually he gets himself into trouble where he (stutter) he ends up saving a public relations guy and he tries to build up his image to get people to like him
270254	64.944	66.313	0.0	13	 Yes
270254	61.701	65.275	-1.3333333730697632	12	 (umm) Okay the one thing that drove me nuts was the camera
270254	70.132	79.413	-1.6666666269302368	15	 So I think I kinda want to do the rest of this review doing nothing but three-sixties but that would drive you guys nuts, cause it drove me nuts
270254	66.221	70.873	-1.6666666269302368	14	 Half the time the camera was doing three-sixties
270254	82.464	90.209	-1.6666666269302368	17	 (uhh) It it (stutter) was funny at times, but, you know, (stutter) it wasn't good enough for me
270254	79.211	82.686	-0.6666666865348816	16	 (uhh) Maybe I was the only one who noticed, who knows
270254	92.351	96.474	-2.3333332538604736	19	" I I (stutter) didn't enjoy it, I I (stutter) just kind of sat there ""Hmm"
270254	90.366	92.154	-2.3333332538604736	18	 (stutter) No

272624	22.79	38.047	0.3333333432674408	4	 It was definitely over five years ago so (umm) this is kind of a surprise in a way to see a sequel so soon, perhaps it's because (uhh) Indiana Jones four came out and people are kind of on that adventure wave right now
272624	49.2	56.695	-1.0	7	 (uhh) It's just something that you watch, mindless fun (uhh) that you eventually, you know, just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it
272624	41.307	49.551	-0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) This movie as as (stutter) the other ones were is is (stutter) not to be taken too seriously, it's pretty much popcorn entertainment
272624	69.733	80.181	-1.0	9	 (uhh) The movie has Jet Li in it, which is a nice surprise, but I feel that if they (uhh) could have used him more in it (uhh) it would have been movie if they did

273539	32.577	47.356	0.0	5	 And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johansson's character (umm) travel to Barcelona (umm) and there you know they are alone and they are young females
273539	18.14	32.849	-1.6666666269302368	4	 It's a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one (umm) with some big name actors Javier Bardem (umm) Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film
273539	70.312	72.14	-1.6666666269302368	7	 It doesn't really work
273539	46.995	71.312	-0.6666666865348816	6	 Basically there they just have (umm) relations with Javier Bardem's character (umm) and he's still involved with with his wife so it's kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause there's three of them and one guy so quadrangle (umm) that's about as deep as the plot gets (umm) they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development
273539	77.475	91.156	-2.3333332538604736	9	 That I think worked with the film (umm) but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasn't been made before It's just kinda sleezy (umm) waste of time completes your mind type of thing
273539	71.898	78.475	0.3333333432674408	8	 There's a little bit of humor in the film (umm) I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor
290546	10.847	20.208	-1.0	1	 (uhh) This is a rated R movie on DVD, it's just recently released on DVD and there aren't any well known (uhh) actors in this movie, a lot of no names

290546	51.584	62.162	-0.3333333432674408	7	 I think it's more of a a (stutter) teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the (stutter) things are based in the high school where (uhh) Molly goes to school at
290546	49.968	52.584	0.0	6	 She has to see doctors and so forth
290546	67.977	73.347	-1.3333333730697632	9	 I didn't really care for it, all I could say it's more of a a (stutter) teeny bop movie

830KzUc6CbU	7.105	13.004	0.3333333432674408	2	Now the director is very involved, intimately involved with the casting.
84140	7.824	12.455	-1.0	1	 (uhh) But like I said, generally which implies that I don't always love them
84140	0.0	8.355	1.3333333730697632	0	Hey ExpoTV, I'm Dea, and I generally love sort of these bad teen comedy sort of movies
84140	27.399	34.126	0.0	3	 And so and her best friend next door neighbor guy, is trying to win back his exgirlfriend
84140	12.054	27.96	-1.6666666269302368	2	 One that I didn't love was Drive Me Crazy (umm) this is a movie with Melissa Joan Hart, where her character, she's trying to (uhh) she's trying to like, get the popular basketball guy or whatever to ask her out
84140	36.259	55.597	-1.3333333730697632	5	 You know, to sort of fake a relationship to make those two jealous, Melissa Joan Hart gives him a makeover, and it's all, it all (stutter) feels very like, it's not, it's not, (stutter) it doesn't have the sort of undercurrent of satire that a lot of high school comedies have, that sort of make them funny
84140	33.685	37.129	0.6666666865348816	4	 So they turn to each other
89835	5.978	12.834	1.0	1	 At the same time, Jackie Chan is known for his martial arts special effects action flicks
89835	0.999	6.589	0.0	0	Chris Tucker is known for his off the wall slapstick comedic performances
89835	17.342	37.01	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (uhh) In this the, (uhh) Chris Tucker plays a policeman that goes to Hong Kong with his, (uhh) to meet up with his friend that he met in the first movie that's played by Jackie Chan, and together they uncover a crime ring, beat the crap out of a whole bunch of people, and generally just do really dumb things
89835	12.134	17.564	0.3333333432674408	2	 Combine the two and you get Rush Hour two, the sequel to the very popular Rush Hour one
89835	56.832	62.502	-2.3333332538604736	5	 (umm) It's supposed to be hilariously funny, it's unfortunately not
89835	39.132	55.527	-2.6666667461395264	4	 (umm) {clears throat} The acting in this one is not really acting so much as one person fights and beats the crap out of others, (umm) the other star of the movie makes loud-mouth, (uhh) off-color remarks through the entire thing
89835	63.058	71.97	-2.3333332538604736	7	 (uhh) There are a few (uhh) good moments in there, (umm) however I really didn't, (uhh) really didn't enjoy the film all that much
89835	61.571	63.699	-0.3333333432674408	6	 It's quite the opposite

96642	0.0	2.159	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey again guys
96642	13.88	17.634	0.6666666865348816	3	 (uhh) They were the mind behind South Park, a very popular television show
96642	9.689	13.972	0.0	2	 (umm) The team who made this is the team (uhh) xxx parker
96642	25.982	53.811	-1.0	5	 (umm) It's all about puppets (umm) sort of the like parody of the old seventies puppet television shows, (umm) but it is not that good it (uhh) it tries to be kind of (uhh) sexy and (uhh) taken into account like political themes like Kim Jong Eun (umm) is the bad guy and (uhh) there's a bunch of like (uhh) celebrities in it who would team up with him because they are like super liberal celebrities
96642	17.202	25.805	-2.0	4	 And also (umm) the movie xxx, not so good but (umm) I guess they should really stick to TV because this isn't that good of a movie
96642	53.28	56.844	-0.6666666865348816	6	 The plots kind of (stutter) but I mean puppets so what do you want
99501	86.974	89.69	-0.6666666865348816	11	 I kind of wish I didn't have this
99501	80.947	87.974	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant any kind of purchase or rental
99501	90.735	98.999	-1.6666666269302368	13	 It's, it's not as bad as, as (stutter) a one but like I said there's very, very little here to reclaim it and make it valuable
99501	89.328	91.516	-0.3333333432674408	12	 I give it a two
99501	0.44	6.888	0.0	1	 Today I'm going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk widescreen
99501	0.121	1.44	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey
99501	9.28	35.383	0.0	3	 It covers the story of the Hulk, a man who is (uhh) a scientist exposed to gamma radiation and then ever since that exposure when he becomes angry he turns into the Hulk, a huge green (uhh) monster man with (uhh) unlimited power and invulnerability, and with the added feature that the angrier the Hulk gets the more powerful and more invulnerable he becomes
99501	6.317	10.19	-1.6666666269302368	2	 This (uhh) is a pretty ridiculous movie
99501	49.399	58.69	-0.3333333432674408	5	 The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action
99501	35.151	49.052	0.0	4	 So basically it's a, it's a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter) suffers because he can't control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors
99501	66.371	71.012	-1.0	7	 I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter
99501	57.69	66.502	0.0	6	 The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while that's entertaining it's I also don't think that's enough
99501	74.522	81.02	-0.6666666865348816	9	 But as it is, it's a, it's a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless
99501	70.282	75.283	-1.3333333730697632	8	 But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I don't know

Es9MkKsMsjU	129.497	139.556	-1.6666666269302368	12	Because apparently not being friends with Craig because he's voting for people who are running their entire campaigns off the promises of committing war crimes is too superficial of a reason for you.
Es9MkKsMsjU	61.971	75.562	-1.6666666269302368	2	But the idea that there is absolutely no legitimate reason for someone like me to not be friends with someone who is voting for people like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is really disconnected from the way that the world actually works.

FB_b1dm0SRY	29.943	39.883	2.0	3	 I just showed up at the new school, and all of a sudden I was really popular, and I had boyfriends and I went to dances and I was on the prom committee and I wrote for the paper

FB_b1dm0SRY	60.953	72.07	1.3333333730697632	7	 So, I think that has really helped me in being able to write characters with, you know, a variety of high school experiences

And I'm pleased to say that for the first time we're going to be offering this class online, freely available to everybody."
_gr7o5ynhnw	14.419	19.809	0.6666666865348816	2	So here at Stanford, the design and analysis of algorithms is the corner stone of the computer sciences curriculum.
_gr7o5ynhnw	35.002	47.166	2.0	5	On a more just purely pragmatic level, I have to say that every year when I teach this class several students come up to me afterwards and tell me it was the key class that got them to ace all of the questions in their mechanical interviews.
_gr7o5ynhnw	20.126	35.613	0.6666666865348816	4	Well, the ideas that you learn in this class are critical for literally every other branch of computer science and not only that also increasingly in the natural sciences in particular in computational biology and even in the social sciences, for example, in economics.
_gr7o5ynhnw	48.242	57.154	0.3333333432674408	7	Well, we'll start out by talking about the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm, in particular with applications to fast searching, sorting and multiplication.
_gr7o5ynhnw	61.99	66.363	-0.3333333432674408	9	Such as computing connectivity information and also shortest paths.
_gr7o5ynhnw	56.912	62.99	0.0	8	Second, we'll talk about several blazing fast algorithms for manipulating and reasoning about graphs.
_gzYkdjNvPc	71.22	92.364	0.0	11	 Teen trends used to be very isolated from runway trends but now with the rise of the internet and also access to cheap runway copies, any potential business for these outdated teen retailers has sort of been absorbed by companies like H&amp;M, Zara, Forever 21, and other online niche brands
_gzYkdjNvPc	60.703	70.743	0.3333333432674408	10	 But they're much more influenced now by the designer runways because of internet easy access to viewing collections online
_gzYkdjNvPc	98.877	106.951	0.3333333432674408	13	 When I was a teenager there wasn't social media and it was much more common to just want to fit in, to look like your peers, to dress like your peers
_gzYkdjNvPc	92.96	98.829	1.3333333730697632	12	 The third thing is that social media celebrates diversity
_gzYkdjNvPc	119.939	133.291	0.6666666865348816	15	 So if you are the kid in school that has the most followers out of that anyone else, then you probably are the cool kid in school because you have the biggest following you have the biggest influence
_gzYkdjNvPc	106.948	120.699	0.0	14	 But today if you want to stand out online you have to be different and how many Instagram followers you have sort of overrides what your peers think of you
_gzYkdjNvPc	159.309	165.108	-1.3333333730697632	17	 And these troubled brands they just really didn't utilize this at least not fast enough
_gzYkdjNvPc	134.885	159.262	0.3333333432674408	16	 And I think that you know it's sort of like just like the the value of sort of businesses, bloggers, and brands are sort of partly based off of the influence they have and how many followers they have teenagers acceptance among peers is also sort of based off of your influence your online influence
_gzYkdjNvPc	7.614	16.606	-0.3333333432674408	1	 One very notable one is American Apparel, especially since they've filed bankruptcy twice within the period of a little bit over a year
_gzYkdjNvPc	1.189	8.325	-0.3333333432674408	0	So continuing with the bankruptcy theme I wanted to talk about some other brands that have filed for bankruptcy in the last few years
_gzYkdjNvPc	17.122	23.7	0.0	3	 Other brands include Pacific Sunwear, Cache, Wet Seal, and Quicksilver
_gzYkdjNvPc	16.105	18.053	-0.6666666865348816	2	 That's kind of crazy
_gzYkdjNvPc	28.018	33.867	0.6666666865348816	5	 A lot of these are very teen specific or sort of focus on a younger customer
_gzYkdjNvPc	23.618	29.018	0.0	4	 And if you kind of listen to the names of these brands you might figure out that there's a pattern
_gzYkdjNvPc	40.998	47.576	-0.3333333432674408	7	 Number one is that trends are moving a lot quicker than they used to when I was a teenager
_gzYkdjNvPc	32.867	41.21	-0.3333333432674408	6	 I think there's sort of three big reasons why these types of companies are having trouble
_gzYkdjNvPc	53.24	60.965	0.3333333432674408	9	 The second thing is that teen trends used to be a much more segregated niche
_gzYkdjNvPc	46.965	53.073	1.3333333730697632	8	 They're not as stagnant and there's been a huge acceleration over the past ten years of teen trends
a-WihYDk6vc	35.7	43.924	0.0	9	Any awards that they've won or raises or promotions or rushing up the corporate ladder.
a-WihYDk6vc	24.186	36.7	0.6666666865348816	8	Whatever it is you want to take this time in the speech to talk about what it is they do specifically any achievements that they have in relation to their work.
a-WihYDk6vc	0.0	6.289	0.3333333432674408	0	Okay we have talked about the person and the family in this birthday speech.
aFhc2ddipoM	96.911	103.399	2.0	20	And so this is a natural and a perfect home for me to come and teach and practice the field of entrepreneurship.
aFhc2ddipoM	65.103	73.337	1.0	14	And after two years of that experience, I decided to come to the USA, get a PhD, and I decided to do it in the area of entrepreneurship.
aFhc2ddipoM	75.54	88.123	1.6666666269302368	16	Darden was a natural home for me, because it's a place where not only can you practice and research and write what you believe in, what you feel strongly about, but it also put a lot of value on good teaching.
aFhc2ddipoM	91.513	97.911	0.6666666865348816	19	And I read about entrepreneurs and the way they do things with my students.
aFhc2ddipoM	6.507	16.925	1.3333333730697632	1	Some of the most exciting times I've had were those two years when I worked for a spin-off of a large company, where we decided to start a new business.
aFhc2ddipoM	0.0	6.808	0.3333333432674408	0	VENKAT: I got interested in entrepreneurship and teaching entrepreneurship because of my experience that I had early in my career.
aFhc2ddipoM	43.024	49.142	1.6666666269302368	9	Because at the end of those two years, we had a beautiful product and we had many customers for that product.

b1LEcg6z66g	77.435	94.469	0.0	11	If you're a teacher or a school governor and you're watching this video thinking about how much money this might mean for your school, it's really worth asking whether your school has done everything it can do to make sure that every child who's eligible for free school meals is actually registered to receive it.
b1LEcg6z66g	106.38	116.808	-0.3333333432674408	13	Make sure you get the extra cash that your school needs because it will make a difference to working with those students and making sure they get the best opportunity in life.
b1LEcg6z66g	0.0	6.339	-0.6666666865348816	0	For far too long, the greatest predictor of how well you will do at school has been your parents' income.
b1LEcg6z66g	7.584	16.835	1.0	2	Every child deserves a chance, they deserve a chance to be the best that they can be and that's why the Government is introducing a pupil premium.
b1LEcg6z66g	23.787	35.024	0.6666666865348816	4	Not only is it  increasing to £600 per pupil but also taking in many more students, reaching many more disadvantaged students who deserve that extra chance.
b1LEcg6z66g	42.984	54.47	0.6666666865348816	7	Schools are using it to pay for one-to-one tuition, extra catch-up classes,  parent support advisors, all the things we know make a difference for children who are falling behind.
b1LEcg6z66g	39.332	43.624	1.3333333730697632	6	The pupil premium is already making a big difference in schools.
b1LEcg6z66g	59.746	70.633	0.3333333432674408	9	We have to break that cycle because of course how well you do at school will depend on how well you then go on to do in your job, how much you earn, how well you can support your family.
b1LEcg6z66g	53.779	60.506	-1.0	8	It's simply not good enough that how well you should do at school is so dependent on your parents' background.

rojyUp4FPSg	136.501	141.662	2.3333332538604736	23	So this is definitely something good.
rojyUp4FPSg	161.225	172.482	1.8333333730697632	28	I mean, how many of you have seen those commercials from Axe where it's showing the astronaut and the girl's going all crazy for the astronaut?

rojyUp4FPSg	10.717	19.759	0.1666666716337204	3	This time, the good folks over at Axe have asked us to review their new Apollo line.
rojyUp4FPSg	2.466	11.328	0.5	2	I am the co-founder of Malestandard.com, and today I am excited because I have another product to review for you guys.
rojyUp4FPSg	22.321	31.761	0.6666666865348816	5	So in Male Standard fashion, the first thing we did was we looked at the shampoo and conditioner and we examined the scent.
rojyUp4FPSg	18.759	23.321	0.3333333432674408	4	So I have the shampoo and conditioner here and I have the new deodorant here.
rojyUp4FPSg	33.894	46.538	0.3333333432674408	7	And if you've seen reviews in the past or read the reviews on our website, you'll see that we are big fans of subtle scents when it comes to shampoos and conditioners or body washes.
rojyUp4FPSg	30.761	34.894	0.6666666865348816	6	Now what I have here is the Fresh scent.
rojyUp4FPSg	52.362	62.262	2.0	9	So if you have a really overpowering scent, it will clash and just create something that's really not what we wanted.
rojyUp4FPSg	45.538	53.362	0.5	8	Now the main reason is because a lot of us like to wear cologne at night.
rojyUp4FPSg	217.537	220.153	1.6666666269302368	38	Thank you very much.
rojyUp4FPSg	67.029	74.454	1.5	11	It almost has like a spearmint type of scent to it, and after using it, you could subtly smell it, but it wasn't overpowering.
rojyUp4FPSg	61.262	67.919	1.3333333730697632	10	So what we liked is it definitely has that fresh, light scent.
rojyUp4FPSg	76.517	83.873	0.6666666865348816	13	It definitely created a good lather and left my hair feeling really good and really clean.
rojyUp4FPSg	74.173	77.517	0.6666666865348816	12	And it cleans very well.
rojyUp4FPSg	84.659	87.415	0.6666666865348816	15	Now this is the same scent.
rojyUp4FPSg	82.873	85.659	1.0	14	Next up is the Axe 24 hour deodorant.
rojyUp4FPSg	89.458	99.248	1.0	17	Now that's not necessarily bad, especially if you're a fan of the scents of Axe and you plan to wear a body scent after.
rojyUp4FPSg	86.595	90.378	0.6666666865348816	16	It's the Fresh, but it is noticeably stronger.
rojyUp4FPSg	107.487	110.752	0.6666666865348816	19	It definitely, it worked.
rojyUp4FPSg	99.326	108.487	2.5	18	This could be your primary scent to wear after you go to the gym or something.
rojyUp4FPSg	181.379	187.956	0.5	31	We've tried different Axe products and I'd say this is our favorite so far, especially the scent.
rojyUp4FPSg	176.281	182.379	0.3333333432674408	30	So overall, for an Axe product, we definitely dug it.

vU0a4F36Ksw	198.311	207.442	2.0	19	 Jamie Gruman: What I like the most about working with the PhD students is they're skilled and they're hungry
vU0a4F36Ksw	183.105	198.602	1.0	18	 A co-author and myself sat together with our advisor and created some research that really delved into conceptually, how do students learn? That related back again to some of the research I was doing towards organizational leadership
vU0a4F36Ksw	15.047	24.837	2.6666667461395264	1	 Not only do you get a top-notch, research-based education, you get to build a connection with faculty that really take an interest in promoting your development

vU0a4F36Ksw	44.211	46.578	1.0	3	 So the culture is very supportive
vU0a4F36Ksw	23.837	44.991	1.0	2	 Ruben Burga: The students benefit from the interaction with the professors, and this interaction is in the hallway, it is not necessarily a formal interaction, but as you meet up with the professors you start getting a sense of what I should do in my case because they share ideas, or I share my ideas and they give me feedback
vU0a4F36Ksw	47.703	56.874	1.0	5	 People are interested when you actually publish something, or when you present something, and it's always questioning the big why are you doing this
vU0a4F36Ksw	45.947	48.593	0.6666666865348816	4	 The culture is very dynamic

vU0a4F36Ksw	56.114	67.191	1.0	6	 Now through the process of doing my own research I worked a lot with specific professors and advisors, and they helped to refine my thinking about where I wanted to go
vU0a4F36Ksw	85.258	114.134	1.3333333730697632	9	 One of my students is currently investigating the role of psychological capital, which is hope, optimism, confidence and resilience in entrepreneurship, and does psychological capital lead to more success among entrepreneurs? Ruben Burga: My research really focuses on project management and the management controls that are used by project managers to be able to create a successful project out of their existing projects
vU0a4F36Ksw	206.442	208.27	1.6666666269302368	20	 They want to learn

vbr3EA8cJTI	78.732	83.334	0.3333333432674408	15	Just take it out of the equation all together so it won't even be there as a temptation.

wF8980oGklk	163.38	168.341	1.6666666269302368	25	 And that's what makes teaching so much easier
wF8980oGklk	167.99	177.939	0.6666666865348816	26	 And from my perspective as an administrator, I'm also the IT person here it means that I am not running around trying to fix things, because they just work
wF8980oGklk	178.117	183.217	1.3333333730697632	27	 Yes, I will recommend CENTORRINO Technologies and have in the past recommended them
wF8980oGklk	130.924	133.899	0.3333333432674408	20	 It just meant they are a lot easier to run
wF8980oGklk	133.508	145.603	0.0	21	 For teachers and students it really again means that they can most of the time be sure if our network is up because everything is working properly - that they can just run their day

wF8980oGklk	10.478	13.513	-0.3333333432674408	2	 It was a little limiting
wF8980oGklk	21.193	32.929	0.3333333432674408	5	 We found out about CENTORRINO Technologies through a couple of other schools, one in Torquay who were using CENTORRINO Technologies at the time and another one up in the western area
wF8980oGklk	17.102	22.193	-0.3333333432674408	4	 And so we just found that he just couldn't service us the way we needed to
wF8980oGklk	38.903	48.344	1.6666666269302368	7	 What CENTORRINO Technologies have done for us is really been able to give us surety in how our system works
wF8980oGklk	32.408	39.743	0.0	6	 They were using CENTORRINO as well and had good reports back about those so we thought we'd have a chat

wF8980oGklk	60.793	69.456	0.3333333432674408	10	 And now everything is backed up offsite by CENTORRINO Technologies and we don't have to worry about it and I know that it is there because we have had to retrieve it before
wF8980oGklk	80.808	92.693	1.3333333730697632	13	 It means that we can look to the future as well and bring on new systems or new products and they are going to be able to service those
wF8980oGklk	72.217	81.349	0.6666666865348816	12	 We pay a fixed fee and we get unlimited support - that's phone support, people coming down to work on our system or email support
wF8980oGklk	98.029	106.492	0.6666666865348816	15	 It just means that we can bring our technology forward without having to worry about knowing how to manage it

zjYEBwXGD8I	82.693	89.311	1.6666666269302368	12	 So we've talked about it throughout the entire review, but honestly what sets Frontpoint apart is customer service
zjYEBwXGD8I	108.505	117.307	0.3333333432674408	15	 It was focused around answering questions instead of trying to up-sell us home automation or an extra camera
