102389	11.246	15.858	0.0	3	 It was a cartoon, of course, but it was kinda like a commentary
102389	8.382	11.517	0.0	2	 It (uhh) was a commentary
102389	18.948	22.093	-1.6666666269302368	5	 It did not hold the attention of my five year old
102389	14.858	19.25	0.0	4	 The penguin was being interviewed about things that had happened in the past
102389	24.945	30.554	-1.0	7	 (umm) We were at the drive in and it was the first movie and there was another movie coming, so there was no way we could leave
102389	21.093	25.306	-1.3333333730697632	6	 She was ready to leave when it was half over
102389	33.785	43.674	-0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) even though they're not considered curse words, (umm) they were using the word (uhh) poop and crap (umm) things like that
102389	30.193	34.425	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It used (uhh) words that I don't like my children to use
104741	6.028	12.924	0.0	1	 This is how, (stutter) called (umm), South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut
104741	1.668	6.469	0.0	0	Hi, (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD
104741	15.097	21.006	-1.6666666269302368	3	 I give it probably about a two, (umm) because of some of the language it contains
104741	13.052	15.967	-1.6666666269302368	2	 (umm), I don't like this movie
104741	41.148	48.593	0.0	5	 And it's about the four boys trying to save (umm), some sort of Armageddon between us and Canada
104741	20.944	41.699	-0.3333333432674408	4	 And, it's the story about four friends, (umm), Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who sneak into an, X-rated or R-Rated movie, and it kind of warps their mind and then, for some reason their parents start a war against Canada or something
104741	53.749	58.401	-1.3333333730697632	7	 It's, (umm) as I said I don't like it, I'd give it about a two
104741	48.99	54.131	0.3333333432674408	6	 It's an animated film, probably about an hour and a half, maybe two hours long
104741	62.08	67.341	-0.6666666865348816	9	 But, if you're interested in owning this, you can find it on amazon dot com
104741	57.74	62.402	-0.6666666865348816	8	 It's not appropriate for kids because there's a lot of cursing and things in it
107585	77.475	80.501	-2.0	11	 You don't connect with any of the characters
107585	74.612	78.475	-1.3333333730697632	10	 They're you don't like any of the characters
107585	95.205	105.055	-1.0	13	 It it's (stutter) not even romantic you know in a way that, the way it's written it's like how can someone you know go that hard
107585	79.75	96.205	-2.0	12	 And It felt like the you know there's like just a little bit just way too typical of a boring film that tries really hard to be funny but it's just not funny at all and it's not it's not (stutter) witty
107585	109.932	119.263	-1.0	15	 You don't believe that someone can actually you know believe in the priest and just wanted get married that badly in that church
107585	104.783	110.932	-1.0	14	 It's just like at the end when you're done with the movie you don't even believe in the original premise of the movie
107585	124.898	129.709	-1.0	17	 I don't know if it's the acting or the way the characters are characterized
107585	118.682	125.768	-0.6666666865348816	16	 And be you know believe everything in the priest, it's just kind of like, the movie's stressful
107585	136.192	142.919	-1.0	19	 So (umm) For those who are interested, I definitely do not recommend this movie at all
107585	129.417	137.192	-2.0	18	 It's just really boring, bland film that even the plot it didn't really have anything going on for that
107585	7.903	22.243	-0.6666666865348816	1	 (umm) This is a movie I though was going to be pretty funny because the trailer looked pretty funny and it's got you know Robin Williams, which I personally like and thought you know he's gonna bring some entertainment to this movie
107585	0.371	7.816	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, this is my movie review of the movie (stutter) License to Wed starring Mandy Moore
107585	24.226	26.254	-2.3333332538604736	3	 It was boring
107585	22.051	25.226	-2.0	2	 But I didn't really like this movie at all
107585	29.664	36.511	-1.3333333730697632	5	 It was just they are trying to you know create all these things to make you laugh but I don't think it was funny at all
107585	26.731	30.664	-2.0	4	 (stutter) The plot It was like it didn't have a plot
107585	43.722	48.124	-1.0	7	 It looked funny in the clip for the trailer but didn't seem funny at all
107585	36.129	44.652	-2.0	6	 Even the robotic baby part was supposed to be funny, it didn't turn out to be funny in the film
107585	69.553	75.612	-2.0	9	 And it wasn't and I feel like the characters were underdeveloped
107585	47.404	69.965	-2.0	8	 And (umm) you know Mandy Moore's character is kind of like, you feel like her character's unrealistic because what type of girl would go that hard core to you know to get married in this church and it just seemed unrealistic and she gets all in a hissy fit and it's just really really tiring and stressful movie
108146	52.841	55.897	-1.0	11	 If you don't see it, you're not missing anything
108146	48.671	53.552	-1.6666666269302368	10	 So if you're going to go see a movie, I would not recommend that
108146	4.86	9.422	1.6666666269302368	1	 I saw Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve and I really like those
108146	0.55	5.142	0.0	0	My review is on Ocean's Thirteen
108146	18.649	22.802	-1.6666666269302368	3	 Ocean's Thirteen not good at all
108146	8.781	19.479	1.3333333730697632	2	 All of the movies have George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and so you know, they're nice to look at but Ocean's Eleven and Twelve were good
108146	23.388	26.932	1.0	5	 I thought the other two were pretty exciting
108146	21.872	23.959	-2.6666667461395264	4	 I don't like it
108146	30.362	34.096	-2.0	7	 Ocean's Thirteen, not exciting at all
108146	26.681	30.814	1.3333333730697632	6	 And (uhh) not a lot of people liked Ocean's Twelve but I still liked it
108146	44.171	48.833	-2.0	9	 It was just not exciting, at all
108146	33.096	45.171	-0.3333333432674408	8	 They had some complications that were pretty small and were resolved pretty quickly without any drama or anything
110565	7.215	12.126	-1.0	1	 I expected more, I'd seen the previews and I thought it looked like a pretty good story
110565	0.929	8.215	-2.0	0	I recently viewed the movie Click with Adam Sandler, and I was very disappointed
110565	29.913	39.354	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) There's (uhh) a dog that keeps (uhh) humping the stuffed animal, there's farting, I just I just (stutter) thought it was a rude movie
110565	13.87	29.048	-1.0	2	 (umm) It's PG-thirteen, but in this day and age, PG-thirteen it's harder to tell what, what that really means, you know, well in this one there's lots of cussing, (umm) there's some bedroom scenes, even though they don't show any skin you obviously know what they're doing
110565	40.2	46.498	1.0	5	 You know, I love the fact of what the story about, in fact in even made me cry in the end
110565	38.673	41.2	1.6666666269302368	4	 I loved the storyline
110565	52.263	62.083	-1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) I don't know why they do that to movies, and my husband was very leery of it too, because he said I've never seen an Adam Sandler movie that's actually been clean and (umm) and actually okay for children to watch
110565	45.837	51.297	-1.3333333730697632	6	 But we could've done without all the other garbage that they added to this movie
110565	61.472	73.816	-1.6666666269302368	8	 So I'm gonna give this a two just because you know, it could (stutter) it had so much potential, and they just like, trashed it up in my opinion
111881	55.775	57.303	-1.0	11	 It didn't
111881	45.129	55.807	-2.0	10	 So I was left watching this by myself, and I went ahead and watched it all the way through to the end so I could do this review and I was hoping that it would get better in the end
111881	61.951	64.697	0.0	13	 Not much else I can say about it
111881	58.169	60.396	-2.0	12	 (umm) Very Disappointing
111881	67.688	73.107	-2.0	15	 I'm glad I didn't pay money to go see this at the movies
111881	65.772	68.688	0.3333333432674408	14	 (umm) Rent it if you must (umm) I would
111881	79.64	84.322	-1.6666666269302368	17	 So anyway, if you don't have anything better to do, then you might watch this movie
111881	72.227	79.782	-2.0	16	 I would've really been upset had I paid (uhh) you know, seven eight bucks a ticket for us to go see this
111881	3.992	10.031	-0.3333333432674408	1	 I was looking very forward to seeing it when I had remembered seeing the previews for it
111881	0.72	4.952	0.0	0	I just watched (uhh) this movie, Happily N'Ever After
111881	11.156	14.86	-1.0	3	 I think it could have been (umm) so much more
111881	9.659	12.156	-2.6666667461395264	2	 I was very disappointed in it
111881	19.687	23.56	0.0	5	 It has Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddy Prince Jr
111881	13.86	20.687	-1.3333333730697632	4	 I mean there was a few funny parts and I expected more from you know, considering all the stars it has in it
111881	27.2	33.637	-2.0	7	 So I guess I just expected a few more, a a (stutter) better movie from these (umm) actors
111881	22.999	28.14	0.3333333432674408	6	, Andy Dick, George Carlin and Sigourney Weaver just to name a few
111881	36.927	45.78	-2.0	9	 However, I started watching it with my kids and they got so bored they got up and left, went outside to play
111881	33.076	36.91	0.6666666865348816	8	 This is rated PG so you can watch this with your kids
112425	109.742	113.326	1.6666666269302368	11	 I think it's a great movie that anyone should see
112425	75.2	110.742	2.3333332538604736	10	 (umm) I think that (uhh) a lot of the more recent videos from Disney such as The Emperor's New Groove, (umm) Over the Hedge, and stuff like that, they've had a lot of real high brow (umm) you know adult comedy but, I think Ratatouille does a very good job in (umm) sticking to it's target audience which is kids and you know, hyping that to how Disney movies used to be, you know, with with kids jokes and not these kinds of inane sexual references so I would highly recommend Ratatouille
112425	112.915	114.184	0.3333333432674408	12	 Okay
112425	1.917	6.329	0.6666666865348816	1	 My name is Jordan and today I will be reviewing the movie Ratatouille
112425	0.959	2.917	0.0	0	Hi
112425	10.577	17.334	0.6666666865348816	3	 I saw the previews in theaters six months ago, (uhh) I looked at my friend and said look, we're seeing this
112425	6.217	11.577	1.6666666269302368	2	 (uhh) First of all let's say that I had an incredible build up to this movie
112425	35.002	49.062	-1.0	5	 (uhh) I know that (umm) in Finding Nemo they had, in fact, (uhh) made the scenes look too real so they had to, you know, kind of fake it down and I'm pretty sure they did the same thing in Ratatouille
112425	17.292	35.204	2.0	4	 (umm) I personally love Disney movies and I think that (umm) Disney Pixar, you know, the animations has just added a real, you know, incredible life-like (uhh) aspect to (umm) Disney movies which is especially true in Ratatouille which looks incredible
112425	58.259	63.28	1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) I I (stutter) love the storyline, it's so incredible, it's like anyone can cook
112425	50.137	58.231	1.0	6	 (umm) I cook a lot {laughter} and so I can appreciate, you know, a lot of the (uhh) a lot of the food references that are made
112425	71.998	75.312	2.6666667461395264	9	 I think I think (stutter) it's incredible
112425	63.677	72.998	2.6666667461395264	8	 (umm) It's a story about a rat who decides to become a chef in Paris and how he goes about doing that but, really I I (stutter) love this movie
112509	5.728	15.059	-1.0	1	 Land of the Dead was (umm) and not as good as (uhh) the other Romero zombie movies
112509	0.0	4.543	-0.3333333432674408	0	This is a review of John Lamaro's Land of the Dead
112509	29.854	39.843	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (umm) Which was you know, and important and interesting but if you like overall it really is, wasn't that new of a plot going on here
112509	17.711	27.93	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) Yes it continued the motif of having zombies represent either (uhh) some sort of disenfranchised group
112509	43.213	55.627	1.3333333730697632	5	 As for the acting, the acting was pretty good (uhh) John Leguizamo was okay, better than I expected and (umm) Dennis Hopper was awesome as always
112509	40.32	42.537	-2.0	4	 (umm) Felt pretty rehashed
116213	57.6	66.602	0.3333333432674408	11	 The process of the movie takes you through how he changed the world and how it comes from his small town to change people's lives all the way across the country
116213	56.373	58.082	0.0	10	 And he does
116213	65.941	70.623	1.3333333730697632	12	 This movie truly teaches you that one person can make a difference
116213	1.139	22.253	2.3333332538604736	1	 Summer here and if you're looking for a fantastic DVD at a value price that everyone in your family can watch, well why not try Pay It Forward, with Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, and Kevin Spacey? This movie takes you through the journey of a child who learns life's lessons and it might just leave you crying in the end
116213	0.271	2.019	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey there
116213	27.748	30.155	-0.6666666865348816	3	 But, word of caution
116213	21.762	28.309	2.3333332538604736	2	 Now I purchased this DVD for a little under ten dollars so it's a great value to add to your DVD collection
116213	38.454	44.463	1.6666666269302368	5	 But let me tell you for your older kids you can learn a lesson from this like none other
116213	29.385	39.045	0.0	4	 The movie is PG thirteen for some mature thematic elements including substance abuse and recovery, some sexual situations, language, and brief violence
116213	46.895	52.554	0.0	7	 Haley Joel Osment has a teacher, Kevin Spacey, and a mom, Helen Hunt
116213	43.912	47.625	-0.3333333432674408	6	 According to the movie it's a simple story line
116213	54.787	57.024	0.3333333432674408	9	 Let's change the world
116213	52.083	55.547	-0.6666666865348816	8	 The teacher gives him a lesson

126872	12.094	18.302	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) But it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, so (uhh) I don't know
126872	8.253	11.278	-2.0	2	 One out of five at very most
126872	18.599	24.268	-2.6666667461395264	5	 It was kind of (umm) more funny to me than it was scary
126872	17.961	19.599	-2.0	4	 I didn't like it
126872	25.813	38.416	-0.3333333432674408	7	 But (uhh) it's definitely in the vein of, like, I don't know, I'd I'd (stutter) say it's pretty similar, in some aspects, to a movie like (umm) maybe even, maybe Saw
126872	23.268	26.005	-1.0	6	 I kind of took the whole thing as a joke
126872	48.611	59.997	-1.6666666269302368	9	 But, I mean, if you're going to watch a movie like that, go see Saw again or something, because this movie is really not good at all
126872	38.185	49.461	-1.6666666269302368	8	 It's almost (umm), I don't know, it's almost too similar, to the point of where you kind of know what's going to happen, kind of all all (stutter) those kind of movies kind of blend together
130366	59.476	73.058	-1.3333333730697632	11	 But it felt (uhh) at least like three hours and the fact that they kept rewinding the story where she keeps reliving the same week over and over, (uhh) it felt extremely long (uhh) and (uhh) it just really went on a long time
130366	57.311	60.476	-0.3333333432674408	10	 (uhh) But it, and that's a long movie to me
130366	11.425	18.172	0.3333333432674408	1	 I don't have the box for it because I rented it (uhh) at (uhh) Red Box, one of their kiosks
130366	0.0	12.425	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I'm Bruce and today (umm) I'm reviewing the DVD (uhh) widescreen edition of Premonition, (uhh) starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon, and here's a closer look at it
130366	19.687	34.914	0.0	3	 It's rated PG-thirteen, (uhh) and again starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon and the (uhh) movie is about a woman who's forced to perpetually relive a terrible week in her life (uhh) where her husband is killed in a car crash
130366	17.741	20.687	0.3333333432674408	2	 And this is a psychological thriller
130366	40.18	48.005	0.0	5	 (uhh) What motivated me to (uhh) check out this movie was my wife, (uhh) really likes Sandra Bullock, so I got it primarily for her
130366	35.022	40.392	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) {clears throat} And so we keep seeing a lot of same events over and over again
130366	49.599	53.033	-2.3333332538604736	7	 It was (uhh) rather disappointing
130366	47.463	50.599	-2.0	6	 Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it
130366	55.076	57.952	-0.6666666865348816	9	 It was two hours and twenty minutes
130366	52.921	56.076	-1.0	8	 (uhh) and (umm) It was very long
132028	1.209	10.57	0.0	1	 Today I'd like review Die Another Day, the James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry
132028	0.63	1.979	0.0	0	Hi
132028	20.385	34.026	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (umm) I mean it has some entertaining action sequences, some cool gadgets and cars and stuff, but overall it just feels tired and old and not that engaging
132028	10.368	20.667	-1.3333333730697632	2	 And this is one of the more recent James Bond movies but I found that it's just really silly overall
132028	38.644	53.652	0.0	5	 It's, this is the two disc ultimate edition DVD, part of the James Bond ultimate edition set, and (umm) has several features on the two discs it comes in
132028	35.73	39.644	1.0	4	 (umm) The DVD however is quite good
132028	66.53	84.911	0.3333333432674408	7	 (uhh) Trailers, DVD-rom features, (umm) great audio and video quality so it's got a lot of features and it's generally a great DVD set but the movie's not really that good so I (stutter) don't think I'll recommend it
132028	53.959	67.271	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) Like audio commentary, (umm) lots of featurettes and documentaries, interactive things you can do
135623	10.178	15.628	-1.6666666269302368	1	 (umm) I gotta say I've seen the other two Spider Man movies and I wasn't really that impressed, you know
135623	0.0	8.534	0.0	0	Hey guys, my name is Emma and I'm here to talk to you about a movie I saw recently, Spider Man Three
135623	31.061	35.643	-2.0	3	 You know, it was probably worse than I thought it would be, actually
135623	14.628	32.061	-1.3333333730697632	2	 They're pretty entertaining I guess and I'm a fan of (uhh) Kirsten Dunst so I always like to watch movies that she's in but I didn't have high expectations for Spider Man Three because I didn't really like the first two, but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations
135623	56.254	63.1	-2.3333332538604736	5	 I don't know, I'm not really into that, and the action in it was really not that exciting
135623	35.531	57.164	-2.0	4	 Granted I only paid two dollars to see it, (uhh) there's a really cheap movie theater where I live that I can go see movies that have come out (umm) recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie, you know? Just really cheesy (uhh) the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying, like the CGI stuff
135623	71.898	79.293	-1.6666666269302368	7	 I feel like there's a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the Spider Man ones and it's just kind of a disappointment
135623	62.479	72.898	-2.6666667461395264	6	 (umm) The acting also horrible, you know, I realize it's based on a comic book and that's kind of the style that they're in, you know, kind of over the top, kind of cheesy, but I don't know
135623	82.314	88.393	-2.0	9	 (umm) So in a scale from like one to five I think I'd give it like a two, honestly
135623	78.293	82.307	-1.3333333730697632	8	 I think that they could have done a much better job on that movie
136196	64.585	67.41	-1.6666666269302368	11	 I actually found it pretty hard to sit through
136196	61.951	65.585	-1.6666666269302368	10	 I don't think it was needed at all and I didn't really enjoy it
136196	69.653	74.714	-2.3333332538604736	13	 I would say you could skip it entirely even if you were a fan of the previous movies
136196	66.949	70.653	-2.3333332538604736	12	 So (uhh) I definitely will not recommend this movie
136196	75.021	82.297	-1.3333333730697632	14	 (uhh) So unfortunately (uhh) a great series that really just lived on longer than I think it needed to
136196	4.98	12.725	0.0	1	 (uhh) This is the third Jurassic Park, obviously, in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by Steven Spielberg
136196	0.829	4.773	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, this is my review of Jurassic Park Three
136196	18.15	27.561	1.0	3	 (umm) What I found most exciting about this movie when I first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars Sam Neill who was absent in the second movie
136196	11.765	17.135	0.0	2	 He does executive produce, but it is (uhh) directed by Joe Johnston
136196	33.495	44.542	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (uhh) The second movie I didn't think was nearly as good as the first, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, but (uhh) the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie
136196	27.798	33.777	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) Unfortunately (uhh) when I ended up seeing it I was pretty disappointed all around
136196	48.312	52.594	-1.3333333730697632	7	 It seems like we've seen all this before, (uhh) and seen it better
136196	44.261	48.823	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (uhh) The third one just feels completely (uhh) unneeded
136196	56.523	62.951	-2.0	9	 (uhh) the story's just kind of a rehash of the previous movie and it overall just feels very forced
136196	52.063	56.735	-1.6666666269302368	8	 There's really not a whole lot original original (stutter) concept left in it
167521	46.915	49.381	0.0	11	 There was like more plot to it than that
167521	42.974	47.745	-0.3333333432674408	10	 It wasn't just your typical like you know terrorist then you know cop comes in and saves the day
167521	50.726	56.316	2.6666667461395264	13	 It's one of the best action blockbuster I've seen this whole summer and I highly recommend you guys seeing it
167521	48.381	51.337	1.6666666269302368	12	 The action scenes were my favorite parts though
167521	58.848	62.172	2.3333332538604736	15	 The casting was really good, the effects were awesome
167521	55.775	59.848	2.6666667461395264	14	 Bruce Willis does his role perfectly, everything is done perfect
167521	63.926	66.512	1.3333333730697632	17	 You (uhh) you won't be disappointed
167521	61.541	64.776	2.0	16	 I definitely recommend you guys watching that movie
167521	5.589	13.014	2.3333332538604736	1	 By far Live Free or Die Hard, or known as Die Hard Four, is probably my favorite as best movie in the Die Hard series
167521	0.0	6.13	0.6666666865348816	0	Hey guys, what's up? Right now I'm going to review the movie Live Free or Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis
167521	18.639	25.675	0.3333333432674408	3	 Basically the terrorists have hacked into the FBI's like security measures and they're like taking over the world, or the United States at least
167521	12.413	19.29	0.0	2	 Bruce Willis is your old, your (umm) your (stutter) old typical cop but basically this time he's fighting internet (umm) terrorists
167521	28.666	33.627	0.3333333432674408	5	 But basically this movie it was more xxx than your average action movie
167521	25.224	29.427	0.3333333432674408	4	 And you know saving as always the cop goes in, save the days
167521	35.59	37.628	1.3333333730697632	7	 They were done amazingly
167521	33.016	36.59	2.3333332538604736	6	 The effects, like the shootout scenes, were amazing
167521	40.859	43.714	0.6666666865348816	9	 The story it was actually done really well
167521	36.628	41.569	2.3333332538604736	8	 When you're in the theater and you're watching them shootout each other you actually feel like you're there
173CpFb3clw	0.0	5.84	0.0	0	So how do I write terms and conditions for my business as a small business owner?
173CpFb3clw	33.964	44.263	0.3333333432674408	3	Review your draft again and then again make sure that it meets all the requirements for your products and services and the regulations and compliance that you working in.
173CpFb3clw	11.565	33.917	0.0	2	Get some examples from industry associations of the different terms and conditions that other people in your industry use, review them, look to see how your terms and conditions might fit into those, sit down and draft them, and then have somebody look at them like a solicitor or an industry representative to see that they meet all the compliances and state regulations.
180971	0.0	6.16	0.0	1	 This is Mama three for ExpoTV
180971	0.0	0.572	0.0	0	Hi
180971	9.101	16.476	0.0	3	 This film was originally released in nineteen eighty-one, it is rated G and it's eighty-three minutes long
180971	5.229	10.101	1.0	2	 Today I would like to review the Disney DVD, The Fox and the Hound
180971	44.949	56.625	-2.6666667461395264	5	 This is not one of my favorite movies, it doesn't seem to hold my kids attention either so no matter what the price of it is, it's not one, that I would recommend buying
180971	16.244	44.233	0.6666666865348816	4	 It follows the story of a hound dog named Copper and a fox cub named Todd and when they're young, they are friends but one winter, Copper goes away with his (umm) owner and he's taught to be an hound dog that hunts and when he comes back, he's suppose to be hunting Todd and that causes conflict in their relationship
180971	56.164	66.193	0.6666666865348816	6	 It does have some special features on here, there is the trailer, there a (stutter) trivia game, there's a read along, which actually my kids actually enjoy better than the movie
190743	77.745	87.585	-0.3333333432674408	11	 And (uhh) that this (stutter) to me was very, very similar to some news event that had actually occurred
190743	63.816	78.385	0.0	10	 They're looking and looking and looking, and she's got a history of using drugs, and she has a history of being a liar and not not (stutter) acting appropriately and then not being (stutter) you know a person with (uhh) everything there, all her marbles together in a row
190743	88.899	98.021	-2.0	13	 When I'm watching a movie of something you know with with (stutter) actors of this caliber I expect to watch something that's new and unique and I didn't find that with this movie
190743	86.884	89.71	-1.3333333730697632	12	 And then that's when it fell off for me
190743	101.151	103.608	-3.0	15	 It was a total waste of money
190743	97.56	102.151	-3.0	14	 So for me Freedomland was a total waste of time
190743	104.095	111.949	-2.0	17	 I don't think Samuel L Jackson should have been in it and I think that Julianna Moore lowered herself to play the person in this movie
190743	102.678	104.825	-1.6666666269302368	16	 I hated the movie
190743	111.288	115.8	-3.0	18	 I hated the events that unfolded and I hated the ending
190743	3.743	7.008	0.0	1	 Today we're reviewing the DVD Freedomland
190743	1.209	4.743	0.0	0	Hey there expotv, Summer here
190743	10.288	17.943	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It is rated R for some language and some violent content and it runs about two hours long
190743	6.447	10.959	0.0	2	 Now Freedomland has Samuel L Jackson and Julianne Moore
190743	20.535	22.762	-2.0	5	 I do not like this movie
190743	17.492	20.597	0.0	4	 Now I want to tell you this from the beginning
190743	25.763	43.824	-2.0	7	 I understand that the movie was based on the bestselling novel, I understand that it was acted well, I understand that Julianne Moore totally was out of character by playing the person she played in this movie, but I didn't see the premise behind the movie
190743	22.4	26.434	-2.3333332538604736	6	 I don't see any sense in Freedomland ever being made
190743	60.444	64.517	-0.6666666865348816	9	 The entire town is trying to find her son
190743	43.323	61.075	0.0	8	 Now (stutter) the premise of course is is (stutter) basically a a (stutter) white woman living in the not so white section of the city, has her car stolen and her son is in the backseat supposedly and there is a frenzy
194299	45.388	47.506	-0.3333333432674408	11	 So he's lost his powers
194299	43.133	46.328	0.0	10	 He hasn't done any superhero work in a long time
194299	51.893	61.155	0.0	13	 So he goes in and trains all these (umm) kids who have superpowers, and he's training them how to defeat, you know, the villains
194299	46.935	52.893	0.0	12	 But something, you know, there's a villain and he's needed to help save the day
194299	62.39	65.525	-1.0	15	 But I didn't find it too exciting
194299	60.693	63.34	0.0	14	 So that's what the storyline is about
194299	64.984	66.872	0.0	16	 (umm) I don't know
194299	1.488	7.137	0.6666666865348816	1	 Today I'm reviewing (umm) Zoom Academy for Superheroes
194299	0.0	0.592	0.0	0	Hi, ExpoTV
194299	9.131	12.126	0.0	3	 I think it's called Zoom's Academy for (stutter) Supergifted
194299	6.636	9.482	0.0	2	 It's actually based on a novel (umm)
194299	19.996	24.039	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) It seemed to be a little bit boring (umm) getting through it
194299	12.283	19.3	-1.0	4	 (umm) And I have to say that I was not overly impressed with this movie
194299	28.397	31.741	1.3333333730697632	7	 I thought, Oh, this is going to be funny and good
194299	24.097	29.397	-1.0	6	 (umm) There's a few decent stars in there where, I guess, maybe that's where my disappointment came from
194299	35.032	44.073	0.0	9	 So (umm) the story is about (uhh) Tim Allen's character (umm) now has lost all his powers
194299	30.921	36.032	0.0	8	 Tim Allen, Courteney Cox, and an old classic, Chevy Chase, in there
198112	77.405	81.239	0.0	11	 You can tell this is made by (uhh) film students
198112	75.949	78.405	1.0	10	 (uhh) Definitely something to check into
198112	81.217	83.963	2.0	12	 (uhh) But it's really good, I really enjoy it
198112	6.137	13.463	0.0	1	 {movie} Everybody, I'm mute it just to talk but everybody knows Napoleon Dynamite
198112	1.019	5.94	0.3333333432674408	0	{movie} Hey what's up Expo videos, I'm here to talk about Napoleon Dynamite
198112	13.75	17.284	0.3333333432674408	3	 It's like the the new teenage movie to watch
198112	12.463	14.75	0.0	2	 It's like the new movie
198112	18.469	24.219	1.0	5	 (uhh) Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a classic comedy of our age I guess you could say
198112	16.284	18.502	2.0	4	 It's like a big hit
198112	36.488	64.836	2.0	7	 But this is definitely something you're gonna show your kids cause it's hilarious, and it's hilarious in a different way and a lot of people don't (uhh) appreciate it as much as xxx it is because they just kinda think it's funny but I think this is creatively done because I'm into like a weird humor, I guess you could say, and there's like (umm) like hidden humor in here just that (uhh) with editing and continuity and (uhh) just the way things are produced that makes it humorous in that aspect as opposed to just (uhh) the way he is
198112	24.246	37.488	0.0	6	 (umm) This is something that you'll be showing your kids just cause you know, (umm) maybe Sixteen Candles or like (umm) other movies like that (uhh) would be like a movie that your parents showed you or something
198112	67.199	75.801	2.3333332538604736	9	 One of the best comedies out there of our age as opposed to like, those other comedies that are actually really stupid with just bad bad (stutter) jokes and what not
198112	63.926	68.049	2.0	8	 And it's (stutters) intelligently made I think

1HS2HcN2LDo	9.44	18.372	0.3333333432674408	1	1) Be ready early - We’ve heard from employers who call job seekers during their scheduled time, only to be met with a voice mail
1HS2HcN2LDo	18.38	23.301	-2.3333332538604736	3	Maybe your clock is a few minutes fast, maybe they were running a little behind
1HS2HcN2LDo	27.758	34.385	0.3333333432674408	5	This will ensure you won’t miss their call and will also give you some time before the interview starts to go over any final points you want to remember
1HS2HcN2LDo	22.6	28.758	0.3333333432674408	4	Whatever the case may be, treat this as you would for an in-person interview – be ready around 10 minutes early
1HS2HcN2LDo	35.85	39.274	0.6666666865348816	7	The Interviewee is reviewing his/her notes
1HS2HcN2LDo	33.385	36.85	1.0	6	[BROLL] Interviewee is nicely dressed sitting at a table with a with pen, notepad, glass of water and phone
1HS2HcN2LDo	47.184	50.609	1.3333333730697632	9	You may be thinking, “Kim, seriously
1HS2HcN2LDo	38.414	47.745	1.6666666269302368	8	2) Clean up - I don’t know about you, but I am at my best when I’m showered, dressed and organized
1LkYxsqRPZM	12.463	20.218	2.0	1	 I personally love the to-do list with my next tasks, and there's a lot more! The pricing is also great
1LkYxsqRPZM	0.0	12.984	2.3333332538604736	0	We've created a simple spreadsheet Just like the one you're currently using but packed with all the great features you get in Modern CRM systems You can set reminders and appointments and sync them with your Google calendar
1LkYxsqRPZM	19.367	30.405	2.0	2	 It was very important for us to make it affordable for small businesses, so while pricing starts at $29 per user It's easy to reduce the price to five dollars by sharing it with friends
1S6ji_d4OLI	46.985	55.138	0.6666666865348816	9	So we dug a little bit deeper into this and again developed a very sound economics OR type of model.
1S6ji_d4OLI	24.117	36.68	0.3333333432674408	5	So what we started doing was ask the question why don't we see the effect of advertising on prices and profits as much as we would like to see or at least what the lab studies would suggest?

1pl2FVdQWj0	0.0	13.423	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey there we are talking about introductory speeches and we have just talked to the person that we are going to be introducing and we have got a real good sense of what it is that they want us to say.
1pl2FVdQWj0	26.082	41.35	0.6666666865348816	2	Where are they from, where do they go to school, what was their life like growing up, what was their career like, what were the highs of their career, what were the lows of their career, do they have a family, do they like basketball, do they eat pizza with pepperonis?
1pl2FVdQWj0	44.101	51.616	-0.3333333432674408	5	Now you are saying to yourself, well why do I want to know everything if they're going to tell me what they want me to say anyway?
1zXAYdPdzy8	2.885	17.843	-0.3333333432674408	2	 I often visit my clients  in order to to inform them about new products that we have  and to let them know  that Mi-Bospo is supporting their business 
200941	58.927	63.01	-1.3333333730697632	11	 The movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long
200941	52.821	59.309	-1.0	10	 (stutter) I guess I didn't like the plot so once the plot got ruined, I really didn't care
200941	69.673	72.968	-2.0	13	 But you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks
200941	62.01	69.945	-1.3333333730697632	12	 It was definitely a comedy and I guess if you're a true Simpsons fan you're gonna wanna see the movie
200941	77.036	89.959	-1.3333333730697632	15	 Maybe rent it, that's probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it, I wouldn't really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show, and the shows are free
200941	71.968	77.378	-1.3333333730697632	14	 So if you're thinking about seeing it, I wouldn't recommend it
200941	3.394	9.203	-1.6666666269302368	1	 If you haven't seen this movie by now I don't really think you should
200941	0.161	4.394	0.0	0	This is my video review of The (uhh) Simpsons Movie
200941	9.889	18.202	-2.3333332538604736	3	 I'm pretty sure they'll be taking it out soon and in my opinion, this is pretty much just a big let down
200941	8.203	10.889	-0.3333333432674408	2	 It's been out in theaters quite awhile
200941	28.237	36.092	-2.3333332538604736	5	 So if you own a TV and you saw the commercials, I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie, and even if you didn't see the commercials, I wouldn't really recommend the movie
200941	18.24	28.389	-2.0	4	 There (stutter) wasn't that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were I had already seen cause they were in the commercials
200941	40.06	46.069	-1.6666666269302368	7	 Some people don't like the current seasons, but I still think that they're pretty funny, and I was really let down by the movie
200941	35.82	40.043	0.6666666865348816	6	 I mean, I love the Simpsons and pretty much they're always funny
200941	49.888	52.534	0.0	9	 They're trying to save Springfield
200941	45.817	50.14	-1.6666666269302368	8	 So I mean the whole plot was kind of stupid
201005	62.41	64.557	1.0	10	 Again, this is All of Me
201005	2.436	4.972	0.0	1	 I'd like to talk to you about a movie
201005	1.119	3.226	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, this is Brian
201005	6.397	9.502	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It's actually kind of a short movie
201005	4.521	6.758	0.0	2	 It's called All of Me
201005	11.236	14.181	0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) This is the Gold Reel Collection
201005	8.562	11.288	0.0	4	 It's only like ninety-one minutes long
201005	15.815	19.898	0.0	7	 It does star Lily Tomlin, and Steve Martin
201005	14.459	16.815	-1.6666666269302368	6	 (umm), It's kind of a slow movie
201005	46.117	63.41	-1.0	9	 (umm) It wasn't one of my favorite movies, but (umm) I'd probably give it a two but, two out of five stars but (umm), if you haven't seen the movie maybe you want to rent it before you you (stutter) purchase it but you can probably get it for ten dollars because it's been out for a little bit
201005	21.951	45.61	1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) It's interesting that Steve Martin is an an (stutter) attorney or lawyer, but he wants to be a magician, and, (umm) Lily Tomlin, (umm) is a spinster and I don't want to give away too much of the plot but she ends up being inside of (umm) her spirit becomes inside of (umm) Steve Martin and that's where a lot of the interesting things in the movie come in
202826	108.684	111.55	0.0	11	 George Clooney does alright
202826	103.526	109.235	-1.6666666269302368	10	 So (uhh) I give the movie two out of five stars
202826	120.627	125.748	-1.3333333730697632	13	 So save your money and go see something else
202826	111.259	121.049	-1.6666666269302368	12	 And I don't know, it makes you think a little bit but most of the time you're just thinking I wish I didn't watch this movie
202826	125.606	127.534	0.0	14	 Until next time
202826	3.523	9.592	0.0	1	 (uhh) I'm here today to review the movie Michael Clayton currently in theaters
202826	2.107	4.344	0.0	0	Hello Expo Tv
202826	20.854	24.907	0.0	3	 (uhh) most people would call it a law thriller
202826	10.867	19.32	-0.6666666865348816	2	 (umm) If you're like most people including myself, you probably will not enjoy this movie because I most definitely did not
202826	35.59	39.604	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (uhh) It's just, it's far too long
202826	24.466	35.533	0.0	4	 (uhh) Kind of like, John Grisham kind of books but Maybe more along the lines of like a two thousand page John Grisham book
202826	49.21	70.962	1.0	7	 (uhh) The movie stars John Grisham, I mean {laughter} the movie stars George Clooney as Michael Clayton and (uhh) he actually, he does a pretty decent job and (uhh) anyways, Michael Clayton is (uhh) the fixer of the law firm, (uhh) takes care of all the messy messy (stutter) corporate cases
202826	38.883	49.242	-1.3333333730697632	6	 If you even look at the other Expo TV reviews about this movie, even the people that like the movie all seem to agree, the movie's way too long
202826	99.186	104.207	-2.0	9	 Hopefully you're not gonna see it anyway because it sucks
202826	71.11	98.709	-1.0	8	 And also kind of complicating this is the fact that his personal life sort of unraveling with gambling and family problems and all sorts of things and basically he gets to the point where he just gets completely sick of fixing everyone's mistakes and it just kinda compounds and (uhh) I don't wanna ruin it for you, but
206585	11.715	25.456	-2.6666667461395264	1	 (umm) You know I really didn't enjoy this movie at all (uhh) it was, kinda boring for me, (umm) it kinda felt as if there were parts in there they just put in there to kinda pass the time on
206585	0.161	11.298	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion on the movie Shall We Dance? (uhh) starring Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon
206585	31.939	46.967	0.0	3	 (umm) He's looking for some some (stutter) extra sizzle to add into his life and he meets up with a dance instructor who is played by Jennifer Lopez and basically she convinces him to sign up for some ballroom lessons
206585	25.254	32.081	0.0	2	 (umm) Basically the movie is about (umm) Richard Gere's character and him being a workaholic
206585	76.498	83.574	-2.3333332538604736	5	 I think the movie was horrible, it was kinda boring but (uhh) if you like to see some dancing, then hey pick it up if not
206585	46.665	77.498	0.6666666865348816	4	 He gets into it, he enjoys it a lot but he's still keeping a secret from his family so he is trying to cope with having this this (stutter) you know, exciting moment added to his life and trying to keep it from his family so he's trying to figure out how to balance everything and you know I mean the dance scenes in here I felt were fantastic I thought Jennifer Lopez did a fantastic job and the girl really can dance (umm) as as (stutter) far as that goes, that's pretty much it
208322	90.805	92.873	0.0	11	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium
208322	88.021	91.635	-1.3333333730697632	10	 So definitely pass on Mr
208322	98.567	101.952	0.0	13	 And my name is Mike, that's been my movie review
208322	92.401	99.378	-2.3333332538604736	12	 (uhh) Save your money and rent (uhh) the classic Willy Wonka and you'll enjoy (uhh) the experience a whole lot better
208322	4.292	13.114	0.0	1	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium and (uhh) this was a film that we took our two year old to (uhh) just a couple days ago
208322	1.268	5.292	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, my name is Mike, and this is my review for Mr
208322	20.255	26.912	-1.6666666269302368	3	 (umm) The main reason why was there wasn't much of a plot but it was pretty boring
208322	13.201	20.337	-2.0	2	 (umm) It's probably one of the worst films (uhh) I've seen probably in the last five or six years
208322	33.785	57.044	0.6666666865348816	5	 (umm) One of the things that was (uhh) kind of interesting is it seems to be a cross between Willy Wonka and (uhh) and some other Christmas style movies (uhh) in which they're just hoping to kind of show you some (uhh) interesting, colorful scenery (uhh) and have a toy store in which you walk by things and things pop out and weird stuff happens
208322	25.942	33.617	-2.0	4	 (uhh) Not, not (stutter) really a lot of interesting things (uhh) seemed to occur during the (uhh) during the show
208322	66.7	77.517	-1.0	7	 (uhh) Dustin Hoffman (uhh) is kind of bizarre (uhh) cast as this (uhh) particular person and Natalie Portman seems to just be sleepwalking through the role
208322	56.563	66.453	-1.6666666269302368	6	 But (uhh) that just after maybe a minute or two of that and it becomes, you become used to it, you're just really not interested in seeing any more of that
208322	82.205	88.692	-3.0	9	 It's a horrible, terrible film and so I I (stutter) can't (uhh) recommend it whatsoever
208322	77.256	83.205	-1.6666666269302368	8	 (uhh) (stutter) Everybody involved in this movie (uhh) seems to just be cashing a paycheck
208592	84.449	88.034	-2.6666667461395264	10	 I just lost three hours of my time for nothing
208592	8.183	18.093	0.0	1	 Now Saawariya is an Indian movie, it's actually a Bollywood production and the (uhh) nowadays (uhh) some Indian movies do show up in the US theaters
208592	0.63	9.113	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the movie Saawariya which is currently running in theaters (uhh) nationwide
208592	20.515	25.406	-2.0	3	 I do not have good words for this movie
208592	18.4	20.557	0.0	2	 (umm) Now about Saawariya
208592	28.098	39.404	0.0	5	 (uhh) Well the the (stutter) thing is that it stars this new guy who's son of the old heroes so it's kind of his (stutter) launch in, you know, home production
208592	24.835	28.479	-2.6666667461395264	4	 (uhh) I think it's like one of the worst movies I've ever seen
208592	64.804	70.493	-1.0	7	 (umm) The only good thing about this movie are the songs and the dances
208592	38.823	64.746	0.0	6	 So it's (uhh) the story goes like, you know, there's (uhh) this new singer dancer at a bar which is in the call girl area or the red light area kind of thing and he falls in love with this girl, but this girl is in love with some other person so, you know, the story is whether he'll actually get the girl or not and, you know, how he pursues that
208592	79.511	84.861	-2.6666667461395264	9	 (uhh) Was bad, bad (stutter) part of New York actually, you know, going to the movies
208592	69.493	78.944	-1.3333333730697632	8	 So if you're a fan of Indian songs and the dances that go along with it you may want to watch this movie but otherwise I'll just rate this movie one out of five
209758	61.771	64.886	0.0	11	 He decides to work at a toy store
209758	60.244	62.771	0.6666666865348816	10	 He's going through all these different things
209758	69.503	75.043	0.0	13	 It gives you two discs, (umm) which one is for widescreen and one is for full screen
209758	64.804	70.503	1.6666666269302368	12	 (umm) This is just really cool and this, what I like about this DVD is that it gives you an option
209758	80.249	83.195	1.3333333730697632	15	 So again I really think you should pick it up
209758	74.183	81.059	1.6666666269302368	14	 Which is great I think (umm) you know, someone who really doesn't, I don't really like widescreen so I'm great that it gives me an option
209758	10.517	26.134	0.0	1	 (uhh) This movie's basically about a child who was found in a convent and snuck into Santa Claus's bag, was taken back to the North Pole and had (uhh) been raised by elves
209758	0.261	10.101	1.6666666269302368	0	Hello, my name is Sara and I will be doing my video opinion on the classic Elf, (umm) starring the wonderful comedian Will Ferrell
209758	29.794	32.49	0.0	3	 Of course he was the tallest kid
209758	25.134	30.794	0.0	2	 So basically he lived his whole life you know (umm) thinking he was an elf

209758	31.869	39.344	0.0	4	 Like he couldn't fit in the seats, you know he always outgrew all the other elves so he always had wondered you know, why was he so different
209758	48.96	54.45	0.0	7	 (umm) It goes through the you know, different things that he had experienced being in New York
209758	46.007	49.172	2.0	6	 (umm) This movie is is (stutter) definitely hilarious
209758	58.279	61.244	2.0	9	 (umm) Which I thought was you know, really cool

20LfN8ENbhM	11.096	16.057	0.6666666865348816	2	Now you want to make sure that you practice practice practice
20LfN8ENbhM	32.557	40.342	0.6666666865348816	5	Think about what they'll be interested in by really understanding the job description and the traits that they're looking for in the job description
20LfN8ENbhM	24.985	32.749	1.0	4	It is almost guaranteed that you're going to get a question similar to this one so you want to make sure that you're selling what the interviewer is buying
20LfN8ENbhM	39.731	43.924	1.6666666269302368	6	Make sure you focus on those strengths
210259	108.974	114.044	-3.0	11	 It's it's (stutter) not at all good, I'm sorry for the words but that's what the movie is
210259	104.753	109.934	-1.6666666269302368	10	 And you see go watch his new movie and it's it's (stutter), you know, crap

210259	113.463	116.728	-1.6666666269302368	12	 And (uhh) I rate this movie one out of five
210259	123.062	126.297	-1.6666666269302368	15	 But anyways I'll give it a one
210259	119.799	124.062	-2.6666667461395264	14	 If I get a chance of F I'll give a F, I'll give it a zero
210259	130.395	137.491	-1.6666666269302368	17	 I mean only if you have an additional two hours in your life that you have nothing to do go watch that movie
210259	125.815	131.156	-2.3333332538604736	16	 Do not go in theaters to watch this movie, this (uhh) movie's no good

210259	24.895	41.15	0.0	3	 So (stutter) so Tom cruise is a senator and (uhh) Meryl Streep is a (uhh) reporter from one of the newspapers or magazine or TV that I'm not very sure, but she's, she's (stutter) a reporter
210259	11.555	25.895	-2.6666667461395264	2	 It stars Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, Meryl (stutter) Streep, and you know that's about it, that's the only good thing about the movie, there's nothing else that is good about this movie and I'll tell you why
210259	47.633	64.288	0.0	5	 The other scene is back in Afghanistan and there's a platoon of, you know, the army, the marines who are kind of fighting, and the third is actually a philosophy professor who's talking to his student in his office
210259	40.529	48.124	0.0	4	 So one of the scenes is going on in Tom Cruise's office where the reporter and Tom Cruise are talking to each other
210259	87.892	91.705	-2.0	7	 (stutter) Everyone that I've talked to, I saw the movie I hated it
210259	63.697	88.363	-1.3333333730697632	6	 And (stutter) all the three of the, you know, all the three scenes are kind of related to each other because they're talking about why did the US go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq and what was the reason and what can be done now? And (stutter) you know whatever they talk about it's, they try to make a (stutter) drama out of it, a dramatic movie out of it, but really doesn't make sense, you know
210259	94.936	105.205	0.0	9	 You know with all these star casts, these (stutter) star collectors in there, you know, that you go watch Tom Cruise in theaters (uhh) you know he hasn't been in theaters for a while now
210259	91.134	95.606	-2.3333332538604736	8	 Everyone I talks to said that it did not make any sense
210433	12.712	23.929	0.0	1	 And in the back we're playing just the opening scene when when (stutter) Will Smith is riding this giant worm creature through the tunnels so he can rescue the innocent citizens of New York
210433	0.8	13.293	0.0	0	Hey guys, today we've got Men In Black Two which is the sequel to the first Men In Black based on the (uhh) I believe it was a Dark Horse comic starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
210433	30.741	36.521	1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh) Some of the comedy was good there was still a decent chemistry between (uhh) Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
210433	23.398	31.053	0.3333333432674408	2	 And (uhh) this movie I thought was a very inferior sequel, it was good it had some good moments, some good elements to it
210433	47.553	54.789	-1.0	5	 And (umm) well overall the movie just wasn't as good, the props were just as interesting the design was just as (uhh) good
210433	36.459	48.005	0.0	4	 (uhh) Rosario Dawson shows up for her first blockbuster appearance (umm) later on she went to star in a lot of movies by Edward Burns and in Sin City and some other movies, Alexander
210433	63.258	66.453	-2.0	7	 It just wasn't as funny, wasn't as entertaining
210433	54.049	63.898	-1.0	6	 The effects were (stutter) not quite as good I thought they could have been a bit better given the fact that it was a few years later and that (uhh) you know ILM standards are continually evolving
210433	65.612	68.288	-1.3333333730697632	8	 I have to give it two stars out of five
211875	65.353	70.753	-2.0	11	 (umm) It has, it it (stutter) makes no sense it kind of shift around a little bit
211875	56.094	62.931	-2.3333332538604736	10	 (umm) Not my favorite show and I do not recommend it for anybody it was just retarded
211875	2.226	7.038	0.0	1	 I talk to you about another movie I recently watched with my son
211875	0.301	2.917	0.0	0	Hi guys it is coach Jim again
211875	9.091	12.555	0.0	3	 Now Fred Claus is a show
211875	6.267	8.714	0.0	2	 It was (uhh) Fred Claus
211875	18.14	23.061	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) It wasn't my favorite, I actually thought the plot stunk
211875	13.012	17.414	-1.6666666269302368	4	 Well if you've seen the previews you've seen the best parts of the movie
211875	28.527	35.024	-2.0	7	 (umm) It's not one of my favorites that I've I've (stutter) watched, it was actually one of the worst ones I've seen in a long time
211875	23.099	26.982	-2.3333332538604736	6	 The acting was horrible
211875	44.72	55.029	-2.0	9	 Okay, oh me, we've seen this plot millions and millions of times, you know blah blah blah, everybody knows you can pretty much tell what the whole movie's about just from the commercials
211875	36.329	44.762	-1.3333333730697632	8	 (umm) Just, it (stutter) oh my gosh it's so (stutter) my eleven year old son did, about halfway through he was ready to go home
213327	64.395	69.506	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (umm) The writing is bad and (umm) it just looks like a low budget film to me
213327	5.619	9.891	0.0	1	 (umm) It says on the box, it's hilarious and outrageous
213327	0.0	5.611	0.0	0	Hi, today I am reviewing the DVD movie, Scary Movie
213327	11.874	20.886	-0.3333333432674408	3	 I think it's geared more toward (umm) the younger teenage, preteen audience even though it's definitely not appropriate for them
213327	9.47	12.775	-1.3333333730697632	2	 I really didn't find it that funny
213327	28.347	38.127	0.0	5	 As you can see, it's playing here in the background (umm) it features mostly high school kids so (umm) hence the audience is geared towards
213327	20.295	28.898	0.0	4	 This movie takes (umm) horror movies and makes spoofs on them so it's actually a comedy movie
213327	46.605	49.441	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) There are much better movies out there
213327	37.805	47.176	-2.3333332538604736	6	 I (umm) like I said definitely do not waste your eighty-eight minutes (umm) xxx (umm) watching this
213327	62.439	64.727	-1.0	9	 The acting is bad
213327	48.79	63.439	-2.0	8	 If you're looking for comedy, then {laughter} rent or buy a comedy and if you're looking for something that's going to scare you, then I would definitely just rent or buy a horror movie because this movie just didn't do it for me
215318	36.069	42.357	0.6666666865348816	11	 (umm) It does have a lot of special features, if you like Britney Spears it's got some music videos
215318	33.415	36.81	0.0	10	 Also has Dan Akroyd and Kim Catrell in it
215318	48.272	55.597	0.6666666865348816	13	 (umm) Seven deleted scenes, a sing along with Britney, a karaoke version of some of her songs

215318	57.141	60.257	-1.6666666269302368	15	 Lots of special features but an awful movie

215318	8.442	10.41	-2.6666667461395264	4	 It's awful
215318	15.027	22.483	0.3333333432674408	7	 They were best friends when they were younger and now they've gone their separate ways and they've come back together and they're going on a road trip
215318	12.712	16.027	0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) they're getting ready to graduate and go their separate ways
215318	24.625	34.385	0.3333333432674408	9	 Obviously starring Britney Spears, (umm) Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana
215318	22.6	25.426	-2.3333332538604736	8	 (umm) Awful awful acting
221137	0.091	10.24	0.0	1	 Today on ExpoTv I'm going to be reviewing (umm) a new movie that is a French movie and it's called Smiley Face
221137	0.0	1.091	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi
221137	27.19	32.809	-2.0	3	 And but this one is just not even really that funny and really even that good at all
221137	10.218	27.332	0.0	2	 And Smiley face is (umm) kind of the same (uhh) genre of movies as (umm) you know the Cheech and Chong movies, and (uhh) Half Baked, Grandma's Boy, that kind of like stoner movie
221137	57.032	68.688	-2.0	5	 But (umm) it's not funny (umm) it's really really just a bad movie and (uhh) if you want to see a good stoner movie see Half Baked, it's really funny
221137	32.697	57.922	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) Basically (uhh) the plot of the movie is this (umm) (uhh) pothead named Jane eats (umm) these these (stutter) (umm) (uhh) treats that are, that have THC in them and she doesn't know that she does it and it just follows her day and her hilarious, supposed to be hilarious, misadventures and mishaps
221137	69.254	71.641	-1.0	7	 Don't see this one, just skip it
221137	67.688	70.254	-1.3333333730697632	6	 Or Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle
221137	70.86	75.921	-2.3333332538604736	8	 It's not worth your money, and (umm) just don't go to see it
221153	59.017	61.993	0.0	10	 I'm going to show you a clip here
221153	70.621	82.167	0.3333333432674408	13	974} It's an okay movie
221153	84.2	86.657	-1.3333333730697632	15	 (umm) It's not the greatest movie
221153	81.287	84.532	-1.6666666269302368	14	 I'd probably only give it a two out of five stars
221153	88.979	91.326	0.0	17	 (umm) You might enjoy it one time
221153	85.896	88.343	-0.6666666865348816	16	 But two out of five stars
221153	96.123	99.547	-0.6666666865348816	19	 So anyways, two out of five stars
221153	91.005	97.063	1.0	18	 (umm) If you're an Elvis fan, you like seeing a bunch of guys dressed up as Elvis, you might like it even more than I do
221153	1.867	7.217	0.3333333432674408	1	 I'm going to be reviewing the DVD three thousand Miles to Graceland
221153	-0.228	2.747	0.3333333432674408	0	What's up, Expo? This is Seth again
221153	15.935	29.866	0.3333333432674408	3	 And what it is about (umm) two guys that are teamed up to (umm) go make a daring (umm) robbery of a casino in Las Vegas
221153	9.011	16.087	0.0	2	 This stars Kurt Russell and (umm) (uhh) Kevin Costner
221153	35.122	37.947	0.3333333432674408	5	 And everybody is dressed up as Elvis
221153	29.474	36.082	0.3333333432674408	4	 And the twist is that it's during an Elvis (umm) (uhh) conference
221153	41.098	45.959	0.3333333432674408	7	 That's what (umm) the whole Graceland part is about
221153	37.486	41.599	0.0	6	 And so (umm) that's exactly what they do
221153	52.981	60.017	0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) It is rated R for some strong violence (uhh) during the robbery
221153	98.757	103.768	0.3333333432674408	20	 (uhh) three thousand Miles to Graceland, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner
221153	45.857	53.522	0.0	8	 It's (uhh) so they do, they attempt this daring robbery and then there's some twists and there's some turns
221274	4.661	15.309	-2.0	1	 (umm) I have been an avid fan of The Simpsons most of my life, and (uhh) was quite disappointed that the movie wasn't anything more spectacular than in an overblown episode per se
221274	0.0	4.873	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey this is Dan with a review of The Simpsons the Movie
221274	30.362	40.891	0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) When things happen that makes it such, (umm) the national government steps in and tries to seal it off in a bubble of sorts
221274	15.366	30.484	0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) The Simpsons the Movie basically (umm) (uhh) it serves on the premise of (umm) basically the entire town (umm) being at the verge of a toxic waste dump and ready to be quarantined
221274	60.284	73.786	-2.0	5	 So there was nothing too novel about it, I didn't find it particularly funny, particularly interesting and definitely not worth a ticket price (umm) let alone probably wanting to purchase this movie unless you get it at a really good deal
221274	41.248	60.815	1.0	4	 (umm) The premise isn't anything too far fetched out of a wacky Simpsons episode, and the postmodern (uhh) references within it to (uhh) movies like Titanic and (umm) other references or nothing more than something you might expect from a halloween special to The Shining or something like that
221274	81.327	85.549	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (uhh) Out of five it's definitely two
221274	73.664	81.598	-2.0	6	 (uhh) It is a overblown episode, would not highly recommend it out of five, (uhh) out of four stars I would probably give this two
221274	89.009	109.814	-1.0	9	 It has cooler animation stressing more three D at the perspectives but nothing too revolutionary, so with that, The Simpsons the Movie, (umm) not something I'd really keep in my collection unless you can get it for a pretty good deal despite the donuts
221274	85.307	89.51	-1.6666666269302368	8	 But The Simpsons The Movie not worthwhile in my book
222247	105.581	112.538	-2.0	11	 It just can't make up it's mind what it is and falls apart in every level and (umm) by the end, you're just not interested anymore
222247	87.483	106.352	-1.0	10	 It's a fairly (uhh) promising premise at the beginning but the (uhh) execution was just poor and it can't make up it's mind if it's (uhh) a prison story or a action movie or (uhh) exactly or military inquest (uhh) type of a conspiracy movie
222247	130.615	134.777	-2.0	13	 Really (umm) it's not, it's not worth your time
222247	112.566	131.066	0.3333333432674408	12	 (uhh) As far as the DVD itself goes, special features (umm) on this includes pretty standard theatrical trailer, production notes, deleted scenes, commentary and (uhh) a little HBO movie called (uhh) Inside The Castle Walls about military prisons and things like that
222247	135.024	142.929	-1.3333333730697632	14	 (umm) Maybe if it's on TV, you might watch it then, but really, I wouldn't bother with The Last Castle on DVD
222247	0.38	7.995	0.3333333432674408	1	 I am Chris and this is a review of the DVD, The Last Castle starring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini
222247	0.0	1.051	0.0	0	Hi
222247	28.537	49.87	0.0	3	 And once there, Robert Redford finds that the prison is hopelessly corrupt and some of the inmates are being murdered and (uhh) James Gandolfini's character, the warden, (uhh) is running the prison (uhh) like a despot and (uhh) there's just a whole bunch of bad things going on inside the prison that shouldn't be happening
222247	7.195	28.11	0.0	2	 (umm) In this movie, Robert Redford plays a (umm) military general sent to (umm) prison for a crime, sort of a technicality of a crime (umm) but he is sent to a military prison and the warden of the prison is James Gandolfini, best known for his role in the sopranos
222247	60.234	67.899	-1.3333333730697632	5	 (umm) This movie starts out okay but quickly devolves, (umm) it doesn't end up being very good
222247	49.529	59.039	0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) Robert Redford decides to do something about it and takes command and runs the military prison as sort of a military camp
222247	72.068	79.074	-2.0	7	 (umm) I feel maybe he lost a bet (umm) towards the end of this movie, it just becomes (uhh) silly
222247	66.899	72.259	-1.3333333730697632	6	 I am not exactly sure (uhh) what Robert Redford is doing in this movie
222247	83.492	88.133	-1.6666666269302368	9	 (umm) This movie, it doesn't turn out to be as good as it starts out
222247	78.553	83.454	-2.0	8	 The ending was a little bit surprising but by then I I (stutter) really didn't care anymore
22373	80.419	87.924	-2.6666667461395264	10	 (umm) It's, it (stutter), I wouldn't suggest this, it's (uhh) not a, not a very great movie, not all very well put together
22373	5.359	9.103	0.0	1	 It has Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in it
22373	1.478	6.359	0.0	0	Hi here with me today I have the DVD called The Ghost and the Darkness
22373	28.327	32.5	0.0	3	 So these people are commissioned to hunt the animals
22373	9.131	29.327	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm) I don't think is one of the best movies (uhh) ever it's about (umm) is about (uhh) two guys who go to Africa because they've been called upon because (uhh) a village over there in East Africa, this is set in 1996, has a problem because there's two man-eating lion, lions (stutter) who are (uhh) killing a lot of the people there
22373	42.106	51.267	-1.3333333730697632	5	 But it's a very drawn out long movie, (umm) not really interesting the ending's pretty lame and kind of flops in the end
22373	31.5	42.687	1.6666666269302368	4	 So they have a lot of problems (umm) during that time and they set up traps which the lions (umm) actually (uhh) outsmart them with, so it's actually kind of interesting
22373	55.565	64.417	0.0	7	 But (uhh) (uhh) this is (uhh) I wouldn't, it's not really a action movie I'd classify more as like a, it's like a story
22373	50.816	56.565	-1.0	6	 (umm) Which is why I guess this movie this movie (stutter) didn't really (uhh) hit big or anything
22373	70.212	79.413	-0.6666666865348816	9	 (uhh) Not the lions, not the people, not the hunters or the (umm) village people so there's nobody really to side with in here
22373	64.724	70.613	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) And then you don't feel sympathetic for anybody in this movie
224263	57.351	63.549	-2.6666667461395264	11	 So, don't go out there and get this movie please, because it's really not worth it
224263	48.242	57.722	-3.0	10	 But the story was so bad that I actually considered leaving halfway through the movie
224263	74.392	76.56	0.6666666865348816	13	 Those are all great movies
224263	62.549	74.883	-1.6666666269302368	12	 If you wanna see a good superhero, if you wanna see a good superhero movie, go see any of the Spider-Mans, go see any of the go see Batman Begins, that's a good one, or go see any of the X-Men
224263	86.375	88.991	-2.0	15	 It just didn't do it any honor
224263	75.689	86.517	-2.3333332538604736	14	 This movie just jumped on the superhero bandwagon and just did not do a good job at retelling the true story of the Fantastic Four group
224263	94.048	99.108	-1.3333333730697632	17	 So I don't suggest you go out there to watch it and waste your money on this DVD
224263	88.929	94.659	-2.3333332538604736	16	 I would be ashamed to have made this film if I was a director
224263	5.2	7.527	0.0	1	 It's playing here in the screen
224263	2.087	5.84	0.0	0	This is Fantastic Four, the first one
224263	20.864	24.688	-2.3333332538604736	3	 The movie is just really not that great
224263	8.722	20.477	-1.3333333730697632	2	 What can I say about this? It stars Jessica Alba and though she may be pretty, she's not the best actress
224263	27.21	33.677	-2.0	5	 The special effects in it is the same and so is the script and story
224263	25.463	28.21	-1.6666666269302368	4	 (uhh) The acting in it is mediocre
224263	34.643	37.419	-2.6666667461395264	7	 The direction was was (stutter) horrible
224263	33.136	35.224	-1.0	6	 All of it's mediocre
224263	45.049	47.685	0.0	9	 (umm) There's not much else to say besides that
224263	37.795	42.836	-1.6666666269302368	8	 I was completely unsatisfied by this movie
224370	83.801	88.143	-2.6666667461395264	20	 Save yourself the money, get yourself another Nicholas Cage movie
224370	87.862	89.979	0.0	21	 I don't know, like Face-Off
224370	89.278	91.855	1.0	22	 That's a good John Woo, Nicholas Cage movie
224370	7.255	10.27	0.0	1	 Here's a clip, clip playing on the television screen
224370	1.508	7.696	0.0	0	This is the Nicholas Cage film Windtalkers directed by John Woo
224370	15.785	18.412	-2.0	3	 Do not go out there and watch it
224370	10.917	16.785	-2.3333332538604736	2	 (umm), I'm going to have to say do not get this movie
224370	19.577	24.528	-2.6666667461395264	5	 Usually I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan but this time he completely missed his mark
224370	18.08	20.128	-2.0	4	 It's just no good
224370	27.429	30.325	0.0	7	 John Woo does martial arts
224370	24.017	27.471	-2.0	6	 But I feel like it was John Woo to blame
224370	32.039	41.928	1.0	9	 And martial arts really like to emphasize dramatic scenes every single second
224370	29.385	32.011	0.0	8	 He does not do war films
224370	45.049	48.563	0.3333333432674408	11	 Running across the room is very dramatic when everyone is shooting at you
224370	40.928	46.049	-0.3333333432674408	10	 You know what I mean, like throwing a, throwing a (stutter) suitcase across the grounds very dramatic
224370	52.542	58.471	-1.6666666269302368	13	 But he tries to make every single little tidbit of it very dramatic and very it becomes very awkward
224370	48.122	52.973	-1.0	12	 But, war movies are supposed to be as a whole dramatic
224370	62.868	76.051	-1.6666666269302368	15	 (umm) There's a scene where they mix actual real life cannon firing video with filmed video, and it's just very awkward to watch
224370	57.91	62.102	-1.6666666269302368	14	 Nicholas Cage does his best, but he can't just pull it off
224370	76.039	78.395	-2.0	17	 The musical score was no good
224370	75.051	77.039	-2.3333332538604736	16	 I didn't enjoy it at all
224370	81.606	84.801	-2.0	19	 So I don't suggest going out there and finding Windtalkers
224370	78.772	82.406	-2.0	18	 A lot of the movie is just more awkward than it is entertaining
224631	98.996	103.608	2.0	11	 I give it a five out of five, and it's something you need to check out
224631	86.415	99.907	2.3333332538604736	10	 (umm) This, movie really makes you think, what if there is more to what our world really is, and it's just a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it you definitely have to watch it
224631	8.941	15.558	0.3333333432674408	1	 I'm reviewing for you today, The Matrix, featuring Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fish, Fishburn (stutter)
224631	0.68	9.722	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa and you can check out my reviews at PM three two one to see (uhh), what I've been reviewing lately
224631	21.722	33.398	1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh), they just came out with these innovative new ways to film that just changed the whole film industry, and a lot of movies have started to film like the way they did The Matrix
224631	15.835	22.083	1.0	2	 Basically, this movie, changed (umm), the way movies are made now
224631	35.84	49.691	0.3333333432674408	5	 You have behind-the-scenes documentaries, cast and crew commentary, music only audio track, follow the white rabbit and take the red pills for more mysteries, mind bending extras
224631	33.385	36.401	1.6666666269302368	4	 (umm) There's some good special features on this (uhh), DVD
224631	57.81	71.631	0.6666666865348816	7	 (umm) basically this is what it says on the back here and (uhh), I was trying to think of a way to describe this movie because it's just so complex, and the way they put it on the back just (umm), it's the right way to say it
224631	50.307	57.982	0.0	6	 (umm) We also have interactive menus, filmographies, (uhh) scene access, English subtitles, and more
224631	75.001	85.859	0.0	9	 And the reality is the world is a hoax and elaborate (stutter) decept, (uhh) deception spun by an all power, spun by all powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us
224631	71.319	75.911	0.0	8	 (umm), Our perception is our day in and day out world is real
226601	54.657	56.385	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (uhh) Didn't get it
226601	52.083	54.27	-1.3333333730697632	10	 (uhh) But nothing really great
226601	56.563	61.394	-2.3333332538604736	13	 As far as it being a Ron Howard film I was actually fairly disappointed
226601	55.625	57.563	-2.0	12	 Didn't understand it
226601	71.469	75.422	0.0	15	 Actually (umm) three alternate endings
226601	61.282	72.469	0.0	14	 (uhh) This particular version actually comes with the first disc which has the movie on it and then you have the second disc that has a whole lot of (uhh) bonus features
226601	77.256	85.03	1.3333333730697632	17	 (uhh) Eleven deleted scenes and eleven behind the scenes featurettes (umm) and a lot of other stuff as well
226601	74.452	77.717	-0.6666666865348816	16	 Maybe if they would've picked another one it would've been been better
226601	84.19	90.448	-2.0	18	 So I would not recommend this one, (uhh) even with all the bonus footage
226601	6.686	9.652	0.6666666865348816	1	 (uhh) This is another Ron Howard film
226601	0.0	6.788	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, I'm reviewing the movie The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett
226601	13.421	24.997	1.0	3	 (umm) Essentially what happens is (uhh) Cate Blanchett (uhh) is living on the prairie and (uhh) someone or something comes in and captures her daughter
226601	9.949	13.693	0.0	2	 (umm) It's supposes, supposed (stutter) to be a suspense movie
226601	31.58	36.301	0.3333333432674408	5	 He shows up (uhh) to help find the girl
226601	23.997	32.58	-0.3333333432674408	4	 Kidnaps one of the two girls and takes off with her and Tommy Lee Jones is actually Cate Blanchett's father
226601	42.325	45.66	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (umm) I gotta say I honestly didn't get this one
226601	35.301	42.427	0.3333333432674408	6	 He's an indian tracker (umm) so he has the ability (uhh) to help find the girl
226601	48.671	52.444	1.3333333730697632	9	 (uhh) Thought Cate Blanchett did a great, did a good job
226601	44.66	49.252	-1.0	8	 I didn't think Tommy Lee Jones (uhh) pulled off this role at all
226640	3.992	13.194	0.0	1	 This movie tracks the story of two generations of Indian Americans that (uhh) basically believe their homeland to come to America
226640	0.0	4.683	0.6666666865348816	0	Hi this is Dan with my review of The Namesake available on DVD
226640	24.935	30.305	0.3333333432674408	3	 The (uhh) generation divide and also with cultural issues are illustrated in this movie
226640	13.351	25.206	0.0	2	 (umm) The father and mother have two (umm) children a son and a daughter here in America and they try to identify basically who they are and how they fit in in this culture
226640	35.022	44.323	-2.0	5	 And (uhh) unless you have great interest in this subject, I frankly lost a bit of interest rather quickly so (uhh) it wasn't the best movie to me
226640	29.754	35.583	-1.3333333730697632	4	 And (umm) unfortunately this serious theme drags on for quite a long time
226640	46.446	62.232	1.3333333730697632	7	 The Namesake does tackle a serious topic and (umm) it does a good job portraying life although kind of depressingly as our main character (umm) struggles in life to find out who he is and how he fits in
226640	43.692	47.236	-0.3333333432674408	6	 In my opinion I, I (stutter) only give it two out of five stars
226640	72.736	76.35	0.0	9	 (uhh) I again recommend it with two of five stars
226640	61.741	72.718	-0.3333333432674408	8	 The Namesake (umm) is rated PG-thirteen and (umm) generally pretty benign of a movie (uhh) so available on DVD
22689	70.102	79.283	-1.3333333730697632	11	 With an all-star cast like this, apparently good director, you know and excellent story, you'd think they'd be able to do it but I don't think it was worth it
22689	66.69	71.102	-1.6666666269302368	10	 I mean I was really really disappointed
22689	14.688	21.185	-2.0	1	 But unfortunately, I don't think an all-star cast really makes up or really makes the film
22689	0.0	15.239	0.0	0	Hi, this is Jack and I'm reviewing the new movie out (umm) The Good Shepherd, (umm) starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, so I mean, obviously you can tell it's got an all-star cast
22689	29.105	33.338	-1.3333333730697632	3	 I really really wish he could have done a better job
22689	22.091	30.105	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) This is for, this is (stutter) Robert De Niro's return to directing for since the last thirteen years
22689	45.318	53.382	-1.3333333730697632	5	 And there are parts of it that are boring, but the really bad part about the movie is all these things all these parts having to do with his family
22689	34.932	46.318	0.0	4	 (umm) I mean the story involved with the CIA part of it, with Matt Damon you know in the CIA, it's it's (stutter) interesting, but sometimes it seems kind of stretched out
22689	61.372	63.878	0.0	7	 (stutter) The movie is almost three hours long
22689	52.462	62.122	-2.0	6	 I mean I understand that's kind of an important part of a movie but it made up about a third of the movie and I really wanted to sleep through all of it
22689	65.313	67.69	-2.0	9	 I was bored through most of it
22689	62.878	65.704	-0.6666666865348816	8	 So I mean it's a really really long movie
233939	62.619	65.555	-0.3333333432674408	11	 (uhh) It tries to be Lord of the Rings
233939	57.102	62.162	-1.3333333730697632	10	 This one doesn't even offer that it's just boring more than anything
233939	71.11	76.111	-2.3333332538604736	13	 Basically stole everything out of Lord of the Rings but made a million times worse
233939	65.034	71.78	-0.6666666865348816	12	 It has a many of orge like creatures, a wizard, a medieval time setting
233939	78.333	80.62	-2.3333332538604736	15	 It was a horrible movie
233939	75.111	79.333	-2.6666667461395264	14	 (umhh) It's just everyone stay away from this film
233939	81.546	85.23	0.0	16	 (umm) So yea that's In the Name of the King in a nutshell
233939	3.015	5.94	0.0	1	 It's a film currently in theaters
233939	0.0	4.015	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I'm here to review In the Name of the King
233939	10.468	12.695	-2.6666667461395264	3	 This one was horrible
233939	5.579	11.138	0.0	2	 (uhh) It's based on the xxx series of video games
233939	14.419	25.316	0.0	5	 (uhh) It takes place in medieval times and it's about an ongoing war between (umm) I don't even know
233939	11.695	14.201	-2.0	4	 I'm giving it a one out of five
233939	32.039	34.904	-1.3333333730697632	7	 There was no saving grace for this film
233939	24.585	33.039	-2.6666667461395264	6	 {laughter} This movie had horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible special effects, horrible action
233939	44.001	58.102	-2.3333332538604736	9	 (umm) It's directed by Uwe Boll who is known for making pretty bad movies however this film see (uhh) most of his films are bad enough that they're funny, you can laugh at them
233939	33.904	42.866	-2.0	8	 It starred Jason Statham so I thought it would be good cause he tends to be in pretty good movies but no, this was a let down
234046	96.961	99.577	-2.3333332538604736	11	 This movie just didn't do it for me
234046	93.359	97.961	-0.3333333432674408	10	 He's not bad but (umm), I don't know
234046	101.71	108.008	-2.0	13	 I I (stutter) slogged my way through it but it it (stutter) really wasn't that interesting
234046	100.104	102.461	-1.6666666269302368	12	 (umm) I really didn't enjoy it
234046	114.381	123.124	-0.3333333432674408	15	 (umm) As far as the DVD goes there are eighteen minutes of additional footage which usually (umm) these scenes are cut out of the movie for a pretty good reason
234046	108.255	113.785	-2.3333332538604736	14	 (umm) I really wouldn't recommend this, I've seen this sort of (uhh) theme done better
234046	124.299	136.703	-1.0	17	 There's an alternate ending which isn't any better or any worse than the original ending, then there's you know theatrical content, (uhh) theatrical trailer and different languages and stuff like that
234046	122.303	124.98	-1.6666666269302368	16	 They really don't add anything to the movie
234046	140.811	145.712	0.0	19	 So that's the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves
234046	137.319	140.873	-2.0	18	 (umm) Maybe rent this but I definitely wouldn't buy it
234046	9.031	24.698	0.0	1	 (umm) In this movie Keanu Reeves plays a sort of (umm) exorcist kind of a character where he performs exorcisms and he is (uhh) in touch with the demon world
234046	0.051	8.814	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I'm Chris, and this is a review of the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiss
234046	41.288	47.296	-0.3333333432674408	3	 He has (uhh) some fairly strange weapons that he uses this, that he uses to do this
234046	24.765	42.288	0.3333333432674408	2	 (umm) His character is John Constantine, hence the title, and this is based on a series of (uhh) graphic novels and he he (stutter) can see demons and he can see (umm) otherworld spirits and he basically fights them
234046	51.225	54.081	-0.6666666865348816	5	 It's a fairly strange movie
234046	47.414	51.766	0.0	4	 (umm) Holy water and a shotgun made out of a crucifix
234046	60.294	65.874	-0.6666666865348816	7	 (uhh) This movie's a little stranger than most, it really was very odd
234046	53.46	60.566	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) I know it's based on a graphic novel and those movies can tend to (uhh) run on the strange side
234046	68.745	93.691	0.6666666865348816	9	 There's a big sort of (uhh) conspiracy to unleash a bunch of demons from hell and (umm) Keanu Reeves is trying to stop this and (umm) Rachel Weiss plays a cop who sort of reluctantly agrees to help him, basically reluctantly because she doesn't really believe him and he has an assistant who (uhh) the assistant has some pretty funny parts
234046	66.54	69.745	0.0	8	 (umm) If you're into this kind of stuff I guess it was okay
236442	66.999	68.807	0.6666666865348816	11	 That's The Ladykillers
236442	58.349	67.65	-1.6666666269302368	10	 So (umm) I'd probably give this one a two and if you wanna check it out (umm) you might like it better than I did
236442	0.74	6.379	0.3333333432674408	1	 This is my review on the movie The Ladykillers
236442	0.0	1.74	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi expo
236442	13.391	16.845	-1.3333333730697632	3	 It seemed like there was a lot of drag time in this movie
236442	6.497	14.391	-2.0	2	 (umm) I'm a big Tom Hanks fan but I really wasn't all that impressed with this movie
236442	21.024	26.823	-2.0	5	 And (umm) for a Tom Hanks movie I was really let down
236442	16.813	21.854	-1.3333333730697632	4	 (umm) Yeah there were (stutter) some funny scenes but (uhh) very few
236442	41.507	44.912	0.3333333432674408	7	 There's several different actors in this movie
236442	27.639	42.377	0.0	6	 (umm) However that is my opinion and (umm) it's rated R for language, crude scenes, (uhh) some violence and (umm) it's a hundred and four minutes long
236442	51.873	58.78	-1.0	9	 And again I think this is another movie where my expectations were a lot higher than they should have been
236442	45.239	52.873	-1.0	8	 (umm) And however, you know, (stutter) it's just not as great as I expected it to be
23656	86.265	88.752	0.0	20	 But maybe the younger kids would like it
23656	88.281	91.416	-0.3333333432674408	21	 So if you're a younger kid then maybe watch it
23656	3.473	7.896	0.0	1	 It is in theaters almost everywhere
23656	0.0	4.394	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello, I'm doing a movie review of the movie Eragon
23656	12.792	16.736	-0.3333333432674408	3	 I also have seen all of the Lord of the Rings movies
23656	8.572	13.273	1.0	2	 Now I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I've seen all the Harry Potter movies
23656	19.218	21.195	-0.3333333432674408	5	 Though they were still good
23656	16.175	19.689	-1.6666666269302368	4	 Now the Lord of the Rings movies got a little long for me
23656	24.156	37.658	-2.0	7	 And actually, while I was at Eragon I wanted to be Eragone out of the theater and away from that movie
23656	21.253	25.156	-1.3333333730697632	6	 I found Eragon's plot to be a little thin
23656	38.324	42.377	-1.3333333730697632	9	 It wanted me to go to, go to (stutter) sleep to be honest
23656	36.987	39.115	-1.3333333730697632	8	 Because I found it boring
23656	47.444	49.721	0.0	11	 I went to get some popcorn
23656	42.974	47.436	-1.6666666269302368	10	 {noise} So I (uhh) tried to struggle through it
23656	56.613	59.478	-0.3333333432674408	13	 It's probably a movie for younger boys
23656	49.678	56.775	-2.0	12	 Ate it, wondered if I'd like the movie if I were eating and not paying full attention to it but I didn't really like it any more
23656	62.12	68.368	0.3333333432674408	15	 It's for younger boys who maybe have read the book too because then they'll like seeing everything they read in the book come to life
23656	58.818	62.152	-0.3333333432674408	14	 Younger boys who can't quite grasp a full plot
23656	77.914	80.141	0.0	17	 Let me do an impression of them
23656	68.615	77.368	-1.6666666269302368	16	 One thing I found cheesy and awkward about the movie was how the dragon and the main boy Eragon talked with their minds
23656	85.577	87.086	-1.0	19	 Hard to watch
23656	82.654	86.038	-3.0	18	 That is what they looked like when they talked and it was awful
237363	67.089	76.25	-1.3333333730697632	11	 Figured this was gonna sweet movie, I didn't think he'd, well I mean I really wasn't probably thinking at all, because if you think about it, The Nightmare Before Christmas is sort of like a musical
237363	63.527	67.6	0.0	10	 It has the same director as the guy from Nightmare Before Christmas
237363	79.551	84.122	-2.3333332538604736	13	 I don't think it's fair of me to give it a one out of five, but that's what I'm gonna give it
237363	76.148	80.551	-2.3333332538604736	12	 So, I don't know, I made a bad choice with this movie
237363	8.183	11.787	2.0	1	 (umm) This movie, when I saw it, this movie looked sweet
237363	0.301	5.481	0.3333333432674408	0	Alright Expo TV, this is my video review of the movie Sweeney Todd
237363	24.346	38.746	-1.0	3	 I obviously did not do enough research before I saw the movie, which you are a good person if you're watching this video because you're trying to do some research before you go out there and spend the (umm) looks like six fifty on the movie
237363	10.837	24.797	2.0	2	 I mean it had everything, it looked I mean it was about this serial killer like barber guy and it had Johnny Depp and he was dressed up looking all sweet and so I was like yes I'm gonna go see this movie
237363	40.868	45.241	-1.0	5	 So, if you don't like musicals, don't go see this movie
237363	39.152	41.539	0.0	4	 (uhh) This movie is a musical
237363	52.293	62.661	-1.6666666269302368	7	 So, if you can get past the fact that there's Johnny Depp singing in this movie, (uhh) more power to you I guess
237363	44.241	52.724	-2.3333332538604736	6	 As soon as they started singing, I was just like, what did I get myself into, you know? I mean, I couldn't, I could not (stutter) get past that
237363	62.759	64.527	-1.3333333730697632	9	 I did not
237363	61.661	63.759	-2.6666667461395264	8	 You're gonna enjoy this one
238063	64.375	71.312	-1.0	11	 The monster possibly were wearing these huge face masks so this movie didn't portray it like that
238063	56.563	65.375	0.0	10	 Actually I think Grendel was basically another group of people that were trying to take over another society
238063	79.531	87.235	-0.3333333432674408	13	 So of her good looks because they didn't try to, you know, make her look evil, they just had her made her look like (stutter) Angelina Jolie with extra gloss
238063	70.621	80.271	2.0	12	 They actually had Grendel as some really ugly monster and Angelina Jolie as a gorgeous mother who would make Grendel look like a sweet heart because she was so evil
238063	91.194	95.976	-1.3333333730697632	15	 So (umm) I am disappointed in the way it was presented
238063	86.834	91.556	-1.0	14	 I mean, we don't need that, she has lips we know we see them she doesn't need that
238063	109.413	113.067	1.0	17	 John Malkovich was okay he didn't help though
238063	95.235	110.413	-1.0	16	 It is an epic tale, it's a good story, it's a great history about people, (umm) animation of the the (stutter) new age (uhh) type deal was terrible, and like I said she didn't fit the character
238063	0.849	4.164	1.3333333730697632	1	 I like to tell you about a movie I saw recently
238063	0.58	1.849	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello
238063	8.542	18.053	-0.6666666865348816	3	 This movie could have been really great if they had taken into the direction of three-hundred or possibly Lord of the Rings, they didn't do that
238063	3.793	8.604	0.0	2	 It's Beowulf starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich
238063	31.729	36.83	1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) It's (uhh) a great story really about a lifestyle of people
238063	18.829	31.532	0.0	4	 (umm) The premise of the story (uhh) first of all this is a poem or a story written by an unknown character as it's the first ever written that we have found (uhh) besides Homers
238063	39.362	42.737	-0.3333333432674408	7	 Grendel is a really bad guy, he's a monster
238063	37.466	40.013	1.3333333730697632	6	 (umm) Beowulf is a good guy
238063	47.683	57.154	0.3333333432674408	9	 (umm) Actually I this in college a very long time, for so long that you began to hate it but, then I look back and I kind of understand why it was important to learn about it
238063	42.136	47.276	0.3333333432674408	8	 Beowulf and the community around him have to protect themselves from Grendel
24196	54.448	58.89	-0.6666666865348816	11	 You all know it's the same thing over and over that happens with Rocky movies
24196	52.342	54.919	0.3333333432674408	10	 You know the acting was okay
24196	66.42	70.154	1.0	13	 (uhh) (uhh) You know, scene wise, there are a couple of good scenes in it
24196	57.89	64.198	-0.6666666865348816	12	 If they would have stopped Rocky one, I think it would have been great but, you know
24196	74.033	81.987	-2.0	15	 But as I said before, if you if you (stutter) haven't been feeling the other Rocky movies as of late, I wouldn't waste my time seeing this
24196	69.873	74.474	1.0	14	 So if you're a Rocky, I guess if you're a die hard Rocky fan, this is a great movie
24196	85.188	94.998	-2.3333332538604736	17	 But (ehh) it was a waste of time so keep that in mind before you go and waste ten dollars on this overrated and highly dragged out movie
24196	81.576	85.549	0.0	16	 I saw it because it was a friend of mine recommended it
24196	4.302	7.636	0.0	1	 It is the sixth edition in the Rocky series
24196	0.0	4.853	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I'm reviewing the movie Rocky Balboa, which is currently in theaters
24196	15.835	18.043	-0.3333333432674408	3	 (umm) I just thought this was too much
24196	7.794	15.728	-2.0	2	 (umm) It's it's (stutter) gotten great reviews around but, to tell you the truth, I thought they should have stopped at Rocky one
24196	25.863	30.295	-0.3333333432674408	5	 He goes out, we all know he's gonna fight, he's gonna win
24196	17.043	25.955	-1.0	4	 Sylvester Stallone was a great actor but he's now pushing sixty and having him in this role, you know, same old thing, you know
24196	40.11	48.414	-2.6666667461395264	7	 So if you weren't liking Rockys three, four, five, then trust me, you do not want to see this movie
24196	29.983	41.11	-1.6666666269302368	6	 So, it was a, it's a typical Rocky movie but I see where it got some good reviews but I'm pretty much a little tired of the whole Rocky scene
24196	49.289	52.514	-1.0	9	 (uhh) I don't know how some people loved it
24196	47.414	49.351	-1.6666666269302368	8	 Don't waste your money
24351	70.681	75.402	1.6666666269302368	11	 I suggest going to pick this up tonight if you were looking for a hilarious comedy
24351	66.859	71.431	0.0	10	 (umm) And there's some special features which give about eight and a half more minutes to the movie
24351	74.612	77.458	2.3333332538604736	12	 Go out and rent it, it's great
24351	10.917	14.271	0.0	1	 And this one is actually the uncorked edition
24351	0.0	11.537	0.3333333432674408	0	What I have up for review here is the New Line platinum series widescreen edition of The Wedding Crashers, starring Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken
24351	15.875	21.784	0.0	3	 (uhh) The movie takes place during a wedding party (uhh) initially
24351	13.271	15.927	0.0	2	 Longer, wilder and funnier
24351	30.412	56.725	0.0	5	 (uhh) But during this one party of the US (uhh) Secretary of Treasury, played by Christopher Walken (uhh) the guys, Owen Wilson's character actually finds himself falling for (uhh) the Secretary's daughter, and they invite them to go home with them to their estate over the weekend and he actually (uhh) pleads Vince Vaughns character to come with him and join him (uhh) over the weekend at this big estate
24351	21.572	30.265	0.3333333432674408	4	 (uhh) The two characters actually play wedding crasher where they try to charm their way into the hearts of bridesmaids and hope to go home with them later that evening
24351	59.456	61.544	2.3333332538604736	7	 It's hilarious
24351	56.024	60.456	0.6666666865348816	6	 And most of the movie takes place at this estate
24351	64.385	67.111	2.0	9	 I can't even stop laughing
24351	61.452	65.385	0.3333333432674408	8	 (umm) I was laughing (stutter) right through the movie
243981	73.365	92.683	-1.0	11	 Like, they also (umm) explain the riff of the materials they use so it's like, what the heck? I, the first twenty minutes when I watched it, it was kinda like three hundred, but a little bit different by adding comedy
243981	60.783	73.207	-2.3333332538604736	10	 Like when (umm) xxx it was really offensive and it wasn't that funny and like they were they (stutter) like pretty they go to the extreme all the time
243981	98.567	103.059	-1.6666666269302368	13	 Like, sure it has cheap cheap jokes
243981	92.381	98.939	-1.3333333730697632	12	 It wasn't that great, it wasn't (stutter) good and it wasn't that funny
243981	103.576	124.66	0.0	15	 Like seriously like (umm) (uhh) xxx (stutter) In the beginning they had like, there's a child like, as a seeing who which child can (uhh) get along and it was Shrek and you're like what the heck, that's pretty funny
243981	102.059	104.576	-1.3333333730697632	14	 But it wasn't that great
243981	127.541	136.374	-1.3333333730697632	17	 And it's just like three hundred, but weirder and not, like they tried to be funny
243981	123.66	127.943	0.0	16	 Ha ha ha, but after awhile you're just like, oh okay
243981	136.371	142.44	-2.3333332538604736	19	 But it's not that great, so I highly do not recommend you to watch Meet The Spartans
243981	135.374	137.332	1.0	18	 You have to admit that
243981	10.617	20.317	0.0	1	 Well there's one thing that you need to know about Meet the Spartans, it is like three hundred, (stutter) obviously as you should know
243981	0.909	10.809	0.0	0	Hello, I'm going to do a movie review and it is about the previous number one movie Meet the Spartans
243981	27.379	32.869	0.0	3	 (uhh) He also (uhh) was in (stutter) NYPD Blue like blue city and such
243981	20.265	27.741	0.0	2	 (stutter) It has a British guy from (uhh) Off Center and also in other (stutter) like movies
243981	38.534	42.148	-2.6666667461395264	5	 It wasn't that great, it was really bad
243981	32.208	39.185	-2.3333332538604736	4	 And like (umm) Well Meet the Spartans is a very cheap knock off
243981	47.773	56.186	-1.6666666269302368	7	 Some (stutter) like people expected it to be great because of three hundred but it wasn't
243981	43.034	48.194	-2.0	6	 (stutter) It was spent a whole bunch of money on it, but it wasn't that great
243981	57.87	61.783	0.0	9	 The things like like (stutter) the fight scene
243981	55.186	58.511	-1.6666666269302368	8	 Like it was pretty offensive
24504	65.742	69.985	-0.3333333432674408	11	 So if you can find it for cheap, buy it
24504	59.227	66.742	0.6666666865348816	10	 But the DVD has special edition stuff so if you wanna see (uhh) behind the scenes and things like that
24504	5.708	18.512	-1.0	1	 This is not a very good movie at all, but if you like the video game Tomb Raider it's based on that and that was one of my very favorite favorite video games ever, and so of course I had to get the movie
24504	0.0	5.79	0.3333333432674408	0	Hi, I'm going to review for you today the DVD of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider
24504	22.46	24.268	-1.0	3	 The acting's not that great
24504	18.709	23.351	-1.6666666269302368	2	 (umm) The plot in it's really bad
24504	32.857	41.18	0.3333333432674408	5	 There's a lot of action and fighting and shooting, but the bad guy's not even that bad, I think
24504	23.268	33.857	-0.3333333432674408	4	 It's fun to watch (umm) (uhh) Angeline Jolie be Tomb Raider, but I mean it's not really not that interesting
24504	45.229	54.131	-1.3333333730697632	7	 (umm) If you can find it for cheap and you like Tomb Raider that would be a good thing to get it, but don't pay over five dollars for this
24504	40.29	45.121	-1.0	6	 He's just does a typical overacting sort of job
24504	56.752	60.227	2.0	9	 (umm) If you can see it on TV for free that's good too
24504	53.909	56.495	-1.0	8	 It's not really worth it
245582	88.5	112.438	-1.6666666269302368	11	 And but there were some scenes that were, that went over the top with trying to make it humorous by, and, (stutter) it ended up just being disturbing or disgusting
245582	81.566	88.922	-0.3333333432674408	10	 Cuz like I was expecting like, I was gonna stare at wallpaper kind of movie
245582	124.129	125.618	0.3333333432674408	13	 Or whatever
245582	112.107	124.201	0.0	12	 And (uhh) lucky for me I have a way to like, shut that off like, if I know like a really horrible scene's gonna come up I'm just gonna like, go into my zone
245582	136.421	140.684	-2.3333332538604736	15	 Even if you haven't seen the movie you should know it's a bad movie
245582	125.197	136.843	-2.0	14	 And I give this movie a two out of five because it's a bad movie, that's no surprise
245582	146.129	147.409	0.0	17	 You know
245582	140.263	145.712	1.0	16	 But it's not as bad as I thought it would be
245582	11.326	16.207	-1.6666666269302368	1	 (umm) I came into the movie with very low expectations
245582	2.027	8.973	0.0	0	Hello Expo, this is my video review for the movie Meet the Spartans
245582	20.315	22.323	0.0	3	 Since the trailer
245582	15.845	19.938	-1.6666666269302368	2	 Like, I knew it wasn't gonna be good
245582	29.474	31.612	0.0	5	 If they thought that way
245582	22.59	29.776	-1.3333333730697632	4	 I heard that people thought it was gonna be like, really hilariously funny and they're not really smart
245582	35.88	53.911	-0.6666666865348816	7	 Anyway, (umm) the movie is a parody of three hundred and a parody of other (stutter) movies and celebrities like Shrek, little bit of Happy Feet, You Got Served
245582	31.43	36.032	-0.6666666865348816	6	 And I watched it because I had nothing else better to do
245582	59.446	82.177	0.3333333432674408	9	 And (umm) there were probably two or three things that were kind of entertaining for me which is a surprise cuz I expected much of my expectations were much lower than two or three laughs
245582	54.428	59.947	-0.6666666865348816	8	 (umm) Paris Hilton and other stuff
252097	67.867	71.192	-2.0	11	 These people seem to not have anything else to do with their time
252097	66.41	68.578	0.3333333432674408	10	 I just don't know
252097	70.88	75.342	-2.3333332538604736	12	 I just don't like it and I hope they don't keep on making more like this
252097	2.137	9.143	0.6666666865348816	1	 It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you today about the movie currently in theaters Meet the Spartans

252097	16.075	25.655	-1.0	3	 Like exactly what the Scary Movies have become, the last three-hundred they made, and things like The Comebacks
252097	8.781	16.885	-3.0	2	 And I don't know (stutter) why I did, but I went to this movie cause I knew I would hate it, cause I hate all movies like this
252097	32.088	36.052	-1.6666666269302368	5	 Like, they just have, I just don't know how they come up with them, they're not funny
252097	24.655	32.849	-1.3333333730697632	4	 They're just all these lame attempts that just keep on referencing movies over and over and they're just not even funny
252097	37.955	45.999	-2.0	7	 (umm) They're talking about the Three-Hundred and really they just keep on bringing up things that aren't funny
252097	35.122	37.748	0.3333333432674408	6	 Meet the Spartans was just the same way
252097	55.216	67.241	-1.6666666269302368	9	 I don't know why they keep on making these kinds movie and I just hope they don't make more movies like this, cause Three-Hundred just came out last year and they already made a parody of it
252097	44.999	56.216	-1.6666666269302368	8	 They're all trying to make this topical humor like Britney Spears, just all this ridiculous stuff that doesn't make sense and isn't, just not funny
252912	55.376	61.494	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (uhh) Like I said it's cheap, I think it runs like five bucks which is why I picked it up, I should of known better
252912	53.629	55.767	-2.0	10	 It made me sick to my stomach
252912	65.383	84.751	-1.6666666269302368	13	 (uhh) Will Ferrel the parts that I watched you know he's kind of funny but the writing in it's terrible and they don't really give him much to work with and it seems like he kind of may have had a jerk director that wouldn't let him you know do his thing and experiment and play around and be as (uhh) (uhh) improvious as he would want to be
252912	60.923	65.714	-2.6666667461395264	12	 But (uhh) consider this a warning to avoid Men Seeking Women
252912	1.907	9.213	-1.6666666269302368	1	 Tonight I would like to share with you Men Seeking Women, starring Will Ferrel and a couple other horribly unfunny people
252912	0.62	2.548	0.3333333432674408	0	Hello Expo TV
252912	13.74	27.631	-1.3333333730697632	3	 It's one of those things where a company has a movie with someone in it and they realize that person is now famous so they pull it out and put it on DVD to trick people into buying it because it has someone they love, being Will Ferrel
252912	9.3	14.241	-2.6666667461395264	2	 (uhh) I highly advise you stay as far away (uhh) from this movie as you can
252912	31.839	36.99	-1.3333333730697632	5	 He's all over the back, because no one else cares about the other people in this movie
252912	27.249	32.33	0.0	4	 (uhh) It has him right there on the cover, (uhh) twice, in the picture and standing here
252912	42.036	44.293	-1.6666666269302368	7	 (uhh) It's just not awesome
252912	36.838	41.05	-1.3333333730697632	6	 (uhh) It has the little smarmy glasses wearing guy from Murphy Brown
252912	50.626	54.38	-1.3333333730697632	9	 I honestly can't even tell you that I watched the movie all the way through
252912	43.433	51.606	1.6666666269302368	8	 It's about these best friends and there's something about them trying to get married in a certain amount of time
254427	0.351	81.997	1.6666666269302368	0	What's up guys I am going to review a movie that I think and actually many people agree with me (uhh) critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie (umm) ever made and it's called Saving Private Ryan it stars Tom Hank's of course (umm) Matt Damon and a cast of others including Vin Diesel if you're a fan of his and it's about (umm) you know a setting in World War Two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war, so there is one squadron's mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is Private Ryan (umm) the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and World War Two what happened there and what happened to them (umm) It's seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they don't understand why they have to risk their life (umm) Ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country (umm) and really just goes through their struggles of your your (stutter) everyday you know American soldier in World War Two, and it's poignant and it's beautiful, and you know it won five academy awards including best director Steven Spielberg of course you know it's hailed by everybody Time Magazine, USA Today, New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, (umm) it won best picture award at the the (stutter) Toronto broadcast film critic special
255408	2.895	6.379	0.0	1	 (umm) Today I'll be talking about the movie Semi-Pro
255408	0.849	3.416	0.0	0	Hi guys
255408	12.872	18.432	-2.0	3	 (umm) Supposed to be a comedy movie but it's not much comedy
255408	6.397	12.485	0.0	2	 (umm) This movie is the latest release (umm) in which Will Ferrell is the main leading character
255408	26.441	36.171	0.0	5	 (umm) In this movie (umm) Will Ferrell is the coach and the star player of the American Basketball Association team
255408	17.741	25.466	-1.0	4	 I enjoyed Will Ferrell's last movie Blades of Glory but this movie's (umm) not up to that mark of comedy
255408	50.676	57.523	0.0	7	 So, he basically had to push all all (stutter) of his players to play a good nice game
255408	35.7	51.207	-0.3333333432674408	6	 (umm) The name of the team was the Tropics and then (umm) and there was a competition if their team xxx xxx xxx that then their team would be totally (umm) like moshed into some other team
255408	61.811	69.526	-0.6666666865348816	9	 So, (umm) I'm probably gonna give this movie (umm) like two out of five
255408	57.022	62.811	-1.3333333730697632	8	 But (umm) mean, it it (stutter) was (umm) not that interesting movie
25640	5.309	8.943	0.3333333432674408	1	 (uhh) This is not the full throttle version, this is the first one
25640	0.0	5.83	0.0	0	Hello, Will here and today I'll be reviewing Charlie's Angels
25640	11.346	22.383	-1.0	3	 I wouldn't go out and say, you know, go out of your way and buy it, but if you like (uhh) Drew Barrymore and Carmen Diaz's acting, and Lucy Liu, go out and buy it
25640	8.562	11.577	1.0	2	 And it's pretty good
25640	25.034	26.813	-0.3333333432674408	5	 (umm) It was okay
25640	21.512	24.278	-1.0	4	 Otherwise it's not really worth the price
25640	36.498	48.583	-2.3333332538604736	7	 I mean, the the (stutter) people elements are there, it's just not really the same, so (umm) I don't know, with special features and all I would say you know, don't go out and get it
25640	26.302	36.87	-0.3333333432674408	6	 It didn't really (umm) reflect the series as well as everyone thought it should have, if you're a fan of the Charlie's Angels TV series
25640	48.252	59.309	-2.0	8	 (umm) If you're going go out and get you know, you get this one and full throttle which is the second Charlie's Angels (umm) together for cheap, go ahead but don't bother
257277	94.117	102.93	-1.0	11	 Wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters (umm) just because the plot and stuff like that is all just regurgitated and (stutter) formulaic
257277	83.671	94.718	-2.0	10	 It's it's (stutter) that kind of movie where they just stretch it out with an unnecessary plot that's formulaic and (stutter) try to turn it into a movie and it it (stutter) ultimately fails in in (stutter) the sense of a movie
257277	105.641	121.677	-1.0	13	 Hopefully one day, when the DVD comes out or something, you'll be able to just easily watch it on youtube or (uhh) rent it even, just to see the dance scenes because the rest of the movie is just there kind of to fill up space and make it ninety minute, minute (stutter) (uhh) feature length
257277	102.269	106.641	0.0	12	 Instead (uhh) watch the dance scenes
257277	126.185	130.068	0.0	15	 (uhh) If you're interested in dancing you might maybe check it out
257277	121.755	126.247	0.0	14	 (uhh) So if you're, so that's (uhh) Step Up Two the Streets
257277	129.068	140.075	-1.3333333730697632	16	 If you have, if you hate dancing there's no point in even checking this out really cause the plot sucks and (uhh) the dancing is only there for people that enjoy dancing
257277	1.767	8.694	0.3333333432674408	1	 It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to (stutter) review Step Up Two the Streets which is a new movie in theaters
257277	0.0	2.767	0.3333333432674408	0	Hey y'all
257277	15.666	31.492	1.0	3	 (uhh) If you're interested at all in dancing (uhh) like (stutter) street, excuse me, street style dancing (uhh) like (uhh) (stutter) You Got Served and that kind of dancing you might enjoy this film
257277	8.562	15.299	-0.3333333432674408	2	 (uhh) It's a teen, teen kind of drama about (stutter) {burp} excuse me, dancing
257277	42.126	45.231	-2.0	5	 (uhh) Just like regurgitated stuff
257277	32.068	42.537	0.0	4	 (umm) I thought it was pretty formulaic and (uhh) just like typical teen melodrama stuff that we've been seeing (uhh) for the last several years
257277	51.494	59.638	0.6666666865348816	7	 If you're a fan of dancing in that sense, just like to watch people dance, see impressive dance moves then you might want to check out this movie solely for that
257277	44.68	52.105	2.0	6	 However I must admit that the choreographed dance scenes are (uhh) quite a sight to see and they're really top notch
257277	63.796	84.671	0.0	9	 It's kind of one of those movies where (uhh) it's stretched out to ninety minutes just to be a full length movie but it would have been perfectly fine just showing the the (stutter) choreographed (uhh) dance scenes, like a ten minute short or like something on TV, or even just like put someone put up a clip on youtube of just people dancing
257277	59.077	64.547	-1.6666666269302368	8	 The actual plot, however, is formulaic and not really worth seeing
257534	57.052	59.768	-1.3333333730697632	11	 (umm) No value in watching this at all
257534	54.567	57.044	-2.6666667461395264	10	 (umm) So a completely ridiculous story
257534	60.314	63.26	0.0	13	 You don't get a good feeling afterwards
257534	58.768	61.314	-1.3333333730697632	12	 You don't learn anything from this movie
257534	72.596	77.897	-1.3333333730697632	15	 Like I said, there's really nothing that sticks out that would be even remotely good about this movie
257534	62.998	73.038	-3.0	14	 (umm) After watching it, I just felt a little bit sick, a little bit disgusted, like why did I just waste my time watching that? (umm) So I think most people would get that feeling after seeing this
257534	77.775	79.982	-1.3333333730697632	16	 (umm) Even the acting is poor
257534	0.67	4.783	0.0	1	 Today I'm here to talk about the movie Boarding Gate
257534	0.0	1.67	0.0	0	Hey, ExpoTV
257534	11.445	14.68	-0.6666666865348816	3	 (umm) I should have known that going in, but I didn't listen
257534	4.711	10.709	-2.0	2	 (umm) Watching this movie is probably one of the biggest wastes of my time (umm) in recent memory
257534	19.806	29.586	0.0	5	 (umm) And she's forced (umm) to flee England, (umm) London (umm) after a {sigh} bad encounter (umm) during one of her jobs
257534	14.269	19.579	0.0	4	 (umm) What this movie is about is Asia Argento, who plays an ex-prostitute
257534	36.119	40.532	0.0	7	 (umm) But she's forced to flee, and she takes up with a different couple
257534	29.205	35.683	-2.0	6	 And (uhh), as you can tell, the movie is already completely ridiculous and not something you want to watch
257534	48.621	54.151	0.0	9	 (umm) And it basically turns out to be a manipulation on the couple's end against Sandra
257534	40.12	48.573	0.0	8	 And, you know, they promise to get her her (stutter) passport, her visa, all the necessary papers (umm) obviously in exchange for services
259470	43.243	59.319	-1.0	10	 (umm) Number one, you've got you know pyramids being built, you've got vultures on like mammoths and you've got people of different kinds of (umm) races sometimes, it's just like ten thousand B
259470	60.783	66.522	-1.6666666269302368	13	 (umm) It's not true and (umm) the movie is really terrible
259470	58.319	61.394	-1.6666666269302368	12	, this is not probable
259470	69.693	74.215	-1.3333333730697632	15	 (umm) Throughout the duration of the movie I don't feel a sense to any of the characters
259470	65.862	70.274	-1.6666666269302368	14	 They don't develop into the characters at all
259470	79.032	85.09	-2.3333332538604736	17	 And If I could say this (umm) {laugh} just save your money
259470	73.674	79.633	-2.6666667461395264	16	 And also the acting is just some of the worst acting I've ever seen
259470	85.826	92.523	-1.3333333730697632	19	 Whatever the movie rate is in your city and do not go see ten thousand B
259470	84.15	86.826	-1.3333333730697632	18	 Save your eight, nine, ten dollars
259470	98.966	103.728	-0.6666666865348816	23	 So again, (umm) this is my review for ten thousand B
259470	0.061	8.105	0.0	0	Hi, today I'm going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B
259470	7.913	11.308	0.0	2	 (umm) ten thousand B
259470	10.308	14.171	0.0	4	 is about (umm) you know, it takes place in ten thousand B
259470	24.536	29.676	-2.3333332538604736	7	 This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful
259470	13.241	25.127	0.6666666865348816	6	 (umm) A prehistoric culture (umm) and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and (umm) trying to save his tribe
259470	32.607	43.525	-1.3333333730697632	9	 There's all kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any sense,(umm) especially in regards to historical accuracy
259470	28.676	33.607	-2.3333332538604736	8	 I (umm) I couldn't recommend this to anybody
259470	91.523	99.358	-2.3333332538604736	21	 There's probably a lot of other movies playing right now that you would enjoy more than ten thousand B
267466	146.389	150.362	-1.0	28	 And even for myself, I still wonder if I got the whole thing right
267466	149.362	151.559	-1.6666666269302368	29	 It's that messy
267466	127.601	133.251	0.6666666865348816	24	 I think it would be enough to swallow (umm) the whole scandal thing
267466	132.251	138.15	-0.3333333432674408	25	 And I can't, I can't (stutter) even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in-depth
267466	137.619	142.071	-1.6666666269302368	26	 And so (umm) convoluted and messy
267466	141.071	147.179	-0.3333333432674408	27	 You just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself (umm) in order to figure it all out
267466	100.712	104.376	-0.3333333432674408	20	 So it's kind of, it's all out there
267466	103.376	111.261	-2.0	21	 It's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl
267466	110.321	113.605	-2.0	22	 And it kind of doesn't really fit together
267466	113.344	127.733	-2.6666667461395264	23	 (umm) I think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production, rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long, drawn-out and ridiculous film
267466	226.477	228.395	-1.3333333730697632	46	 It's just not worth it
267466	223.174	225.84	-2.6666667461395264	44	 Don't waste your time seeing it in a theater
267466	225.1	227.477	-3.0	45	 Don't even waste your time renting this one
267466	214.833	222.308	-2.3333332538604736	42	 But this one was kind of fantastical and weird and out there and just not worth my time
267466	221.448	223.865	-1.6666666269302368	43	 Again, one out of five stars
267466	207.829	211.922	0.6666666865348816	40	 (umm) I I've (stutter) seen some foreign film lately that I really enjoyed
267466	210.922	215.454	0.6666666865348816	41	 I really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters
267466	0.73	7.088	0.0	1	 This is Aubs eighty four and today I'm going to talk to you about the movie The Wedding Director
267466	0.0	0.652	0.0	0	Hey, ExpoTV
267466	9.111	12.615	0.0	3	 (umm) It's set in France and it's definitely subtitled
267466	6.995	9.572	0.0	2	 (umm) This is a foreign film
267466	16.075	22.872	-1.6666666269302368	5	 (umm) If you don't mind subtitles and you're into foreign films, I would still say don't get your hopes up
267466	11.615	15.818	-1.3333333730697632	4	 So if you're not a fan of sub-titles, you're gonna want to steer clear of this one
267466	23.867	29.028	-2.6666667461395264	7	 Honestly, I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for this film to be over
267466	21.872	24.578	-1.6666666269302368	6	 It's just, it really isn't that good
267466	29.365	31.981	-1.0	9	 It it (stutter) drew on and on
267466	28.407	30.365	-1.0	8	 It was long
267466	52.612	65.515	0.0	13	 (umm) The basic plot of the story is that this guy, Franco, is a film maker and he's worried about (uhh) getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy
267466	41.268	52.524	-2.6666667461395264	12	 But when it's, in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of ridiculousness actually
267466	38.644	41.908	-1.0	11	 And, you know, generally I don't mind that
267466	31.799	39.224	0.6666666865348816	10	 (umm) In typical foreign film fashion, it was all about character development, and all about the background story and getting to know people
267466	203.439	207.462	-1.6666666269302368	39	 (umm) But that would've been a better alternative to what they did here
267466	197.153	203.79	0.0	38	 (umm) If they would've broken it up I mean, then it's just different films so you can't even, it's comparing apples to oranges kind of
267466	71.349	76.19	0.0	15	 He has to leave (umm) because he's kind of been indicted for some things
267466	64.794	72.349	0.0	14	 So he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and Franco's forced to flee his country
267466	76.208	80.161	-2.0	17	 He's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland
267466	75.19	77.208	-1.0	16	 He's not looking very good
267466	173.158	179.137	-1.0	33	 It would have took me another two or three viewings (uhh) just to to (stutter) figure this out
267466	79.98	95.856	0.6666666865348816	18	 (umm) So he leaves and in his new city, he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says, well can you film my daughter's wedding And Franco says, sure, I'll do that
267466	157.334	167.443	-1.0	31	 It, it (stutter) could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation
267466	151.198	158.334	-1.3333333730697632	30	 (umm) And that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge shebang that happened because of it
267466	191.337	197.265	-1.6666666269302368	37	 (umm) I can't think of anything (uhh) for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating
267466	188.423	191.339	-3.0	36	 I'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating
267466	182.317	188.395	-1.0	35	 I mean entertainment value here is what I want and that's not what I was given in this film at all
267466	178.137	183.177	-2.3333332538604736	34	 And I don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated, foreign or not
267466	95.335	101.493	0.0	19	 And basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married
267466	167.471	173.839	-2.0	32	 (umm) When you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one, it's just to much to digest
267694	74.572	77.597	-1.6666666269302368	11	 (uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said
267694	67.129	73.976	0.3333333432674408	10	 (uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called the hourglass
267694	79.141	93.282	-2.3333332538604736	13	 (uhh) It's like one of the most stupid comedies, like you don't really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends you're like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars
267694	76.927	79.313	-1.3333333730697632	12	 It could have been a lot better
267694	97.101	99.368	-2.3333332538604736	15	 Don't see it in the theaters
267694	93.539	98.101	-2.3333332538604736	14	 (uhh) So I really don't recommend seeing it
267694	100.792	105.654	-1.3333333730697632	17	 (uhh) Just completely ignore like this movie
267694	98.368	101.712	-1.0	16	 Do not see it on dvd
267694	112.097	114.633	-0.6666666865348816	19	 Like who wants to do this
267694	104.654	112.648	-2.3333332538604736	18	 I don't get how these movies get put in like like (stutter) theaters, or like production even
267694	1.747	5.671	0.0	1	 I have a movie review for Superhero Movie
267694	0.0	2.747	0.0	0	What's up expo tv
267694	7.215	18.043	-0.3333333432674408	3	 It's about ninety minutes long and it's rated PG-thirteen for (uhh) crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language
267694	5.279	7.746	0.0	2	 (uhh) Currently in theaters
267694	23.877	26.743	0.0	5	 (uhh) I guess so more people can see it
267694	18.36	24.159	0.0	4	 (uhh) It's from the makers of Scary Movie but this one's rated PG-thirteen
267694	33.854	36.151	-2.0	7	 I thought it was kind of bad
267694	26.092	34.854	-1.6666666269302368	6	 It it's (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and it's not as good as pretty much any spoof movie
267694	55.206	66.971	0.0	9	 And (uhh) it's just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie that's currently out
267694	36.379	55.597	0.0	8	 (uhh) I guess the movie's about how (uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough
272838	72.666	75.183	-1.0	11	 I don't even know why I saw it
272838	71.06	73.666	-1.6666666269302368	10	 (umm) Honestly that sounds pretty stupid
272838	78.463	80.77	-0.6666666865348816	13	 Don't see Death Race
272838	75.989	79.194	-0.6666666865348816	12	 (uhh) But at least now you guys are warned
272838	82.444	84.512	-2.3333332538604736	15	 It's really pretty bad
272838	80.658	82.476	-0.3333333432674408	14	 (uhh) I wouldn't even rent it
272838	85.866	91.206	0.0	17	 If you like senseless action, Death Race is your movie
272838	84.42	86.866	0.0	16	 (uhh) I mean, there's a lot of action
272838	3.034	7.836	0.0	1	 (umm) Today I'm reviewing the movie Death Race
272838	1.458	3.446	-1.0	0	Hello Expo TV
272838	12.702	14.87	-1.3333333730697632	3	 (uhh) It really wasn't very good
272838	9.749	13.194	-2.0	2	 (uhh) This means two out of five
272838	16.803	24.149	0.0	5	 You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of, drug runner
272838	14.508	16.945	0.0	4	 (uhh) It stars Jason Statham
272838	32.438	40.302	0.0	7	 It's about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit
272838	24.675	33.228	-2.0	6	 Anyways, (umm) where do I start? (umm) The movie takes place in two thousand twelve
272838	66.75	69.426	0.0	9	 So, that's kind of the premise of the movie
272838	39.751	67.56	-0.3333333432674408	8	 It's a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation that's these death races and they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and they kill each other and if you win, it's five races, you get your freedom
273207	55.485	65.455	-1.6666666269302368	10	 But he has issues and the young guy has issues and there's a lot of sex in it and it's, it's just not a movie at all that I would recommend
273207	2.805	10.919	0.0	1	 Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason (stutter) Schwartzman and (umm) the movie is rated R
273207	0.57	3.715	0.0	0	I am reviewing shop girl
273207	16.933	20.896	-1.6666666269302368	3	 I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter}
273207	10.029	15.429	0.6666666865348816	2	 And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back
273207	25.583	42.238	0.3333333432674408	5	 And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of (umm) Roxanne or (umm) You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy
273207	20.714	26.154	0.3333333432674408	4	 It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin
273207	43.722	47.306	-0.3333333432674408	7	 (umm) It's actually a little odd
273207	41.238	44.113	-0.3333333432674408	6	 It is, to me very dark
273207	50.157	56.036	-0.3333333432674408	9	 A young guy that's not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur who's Steve Martin
273207	46.306	51.157	0.0	8	 It's this girl (umm) basically is kinda torn between these two guys
273250	108.734	111.989	-2.3333332538604736	24	 The premise is barely there at all
273250	111.358	115.022	-1.3333333730697632	25	 It's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length
273250	114.451	122.156	-2.6666667461395264	26	 Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk
273250	121.635	124.401	-2.0	27	 So, one out five for Traitor
273250	94.926	101.663	-0.3333333432674408	20	 And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies
273250	100.842	104.277	-2.0	21	 There are so many better ones to be doing
273250	104.135	108.068	-1.3333333730697632	22	 So, I have to say, one out of five
273250	107.387	109.405	-3.0	23	 This was horrible
273250	6.088	9.013	0.0	1	 As formality, here is my movie ticket
273250	0.291	6.18	0.6666666865348816	0	Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night
273250	11.435	16.925	-0.6666666865348816	3	 So, Traitor is a movie about (uhh), it's a basic spy movie
273250	9.899	11.507	0.0	2	 And there it went
273250	20.116	23.291	-0.6666666865348816	5	 But I will try to hack it together for you
273250	16.274	20.926	-3.0	4	 The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form
273250	31.989	38.855	-0.3333333432674408	7	 And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US, (uhh) is always seems to be connected to all of it
273250	22.76	32.649	0.0	6	 So, this (uhh), sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating (uhh), a bunch of crazy stuff that happened
273250	53.26	55.059	0.0	9	 That's the premise
273250	38.185	52.594	-0.3333333432674408	8	 So, it's, he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here
273250	60.534	65.565	-1.3333333730697632	11	 There's the investigation element, but that's it
273250	54.298	60.406	-2.6666667461395264	10	 It's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it
273250	67.817	69.486	-1.3333333730697632	13	 There is none
273250	64.565	67.969	-2.6666667461395264	12	 You know, what's the story, what's the point
273250	71.708	76.27	-0.6666666865348816	15	 The script was written as sort of a, sub-element
273250	69.374	72.11	-2.0	14	 That's the flaw of this movie
273250	80.947	87.375	-2.3333332538604736	17	 And, that's why I can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious
273250	76.208	81.089	-2.3333332538604736	16	 You know, it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to
273250	93.04	95.167	0.0	19	 There are so many
273250	87.692	93.771	-1.6666666269302368	18	 And this isn't worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this
275267	70.322	73.527	-2.3333332538604736	11	 (uhh) I wouldn't see it at the theater and I wouldn't rent it either
275267	64.974	69.945	-2.6666667461395264	10	 I mean I wouldn't recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time
275267	74.732	77.278	-1.3333333730697632	13	 (uhh) Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know
275267	72.527	74.674	-1.3333333730697632	12	 I'd just try to forget about it
275267	78.932	82.616	0.0	15	 But (umm) that's my opinion anyway
275267	76.278	79.174	-1.6666666269302368	14	 Just forget it had ever happened
275267	1.039	15.468	-2.6666667461395264	1	 I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called (umm) Beer for My Horses and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad
275267	0.55	2.039	0.0	0	Hi there
275267	31.061	39.843	-1.3333333730697632	3	 He's a former (umm) rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either
275267	14.947	31.522	-1.3333333730697632	2	 It has Tom Skerrit in it, (uhh) that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor, it's got Toby Keith, who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting, and it's also got (uhh) Ted Nugent
275267	46.316	48.853	0.0	5	 It's rated PG-thirteen
275267	38.843	47.316	-1.3333333730697632	4	 So I mean you're you're (stutter) putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess that's what you're gonna get
275267	55.056	58.511	0.0	7	 The sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway
275267	48.252	55.767	0.0	6	 The premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something
275267	62.499	65.974	-0.6666666865348816	9	 and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think
275267	57.511	63.499	0.0	8	 So they take this road trip and that's kind of how the movie goes
27v7Blr0vjw	0.0	12.366	-0.3333333432674408	0	Some Boards have provision for committee members to serve who are not full Board members, not voting members of the Board.
27v7Blr0vjw	24.855	26.034	0.0	3	Student affairs academic affairs, that's another area where you may have some non-Board members serving.
27v7Blr0vjw	15.077	25.855	-0.3333333432674408	2	So you may not have all of the skills and abilities that you need for the audit committee on your full voting Board members but you among your committee members that expertise.
27v7Blr0vjw	25.254	27.79	0.0	5	Faculty member similarly could serve that way on an academic affairs committee; great opportunity to expand the interaction between Board members, faculty and students and enrich the discussion of those committees with the kinds of perspectives that you need in committee work.
27v7Blr0vjw	25.034	26.254	0.0	4	For instance, we don't necessarily recommend the students serve as voting members of the Board because of conflict of interest concerns, but students could be a wonderful asset on the student affairs committee and can serve as full members of the committee and vote on proposals that will come before the Board but aren't voting as full Board members when the resolutions of the Board are passed.
28006	132.879	135.635	-3.0	20	 Don't get this movie
28006	135.753	143.168	-3.0	21	 It's from the director of Blade, that should have told me in the first place cause Blade sucked, this sucks
28006	142.517	146.471	-2.3333332538604736	22	 Don't rent it, don't buy it, don't waste your time
28006	6.696	9.482	0.0	1	 This (uhh) stars Sean Connery
28006	0.0	6.948	-2.6666667461395264	0	Hi, my name is Logan and this piece of dog crap is The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
28006	12.463	31.253	-0.3333333432674408	3	 (umm) It's set in like the eighteen hundreds and it's like fantasy and (uhh) you know, the (stutter) first of all the main star, or the main guy in (stutter), there's like all these like Captain Nemo's in it and then other people, other famousishy people from around that time were in it
28006	9.28	12.226	-3.0	2	 It's just so stupid
28006	34.054	40.711	-1.6666666269302368	5	 I don't know what they were thinking when they decided that Sean Connery should star as Alan Quartermain
28006	30.851	34.106	-0.3333333432674408	4	 I have never heard of Alan Quartermain
28006	45.628	49.102	-2.3333332538604736	7	 It it's (stutter) pretty dumb
28006	40.449	46.219	-2.0	6	 It doesn't make any sense but (uhh) I don't know
28006	59.835	64.118	-2.0	9	 It's really just a dull story line
28006	48.79	60.835	-0.3333333432674408	8	 There's like a vampire in it, an invisible guy, Captain Nemo, a guy that can't die cause he's like he starts out as a good guy and then he goes to a bad guy
28006	82.175	87.854	-2.3333332538604736	11	 I can't do a very (stutter) good Sean Connery voice but this was really lame movie
28006	63.956	83.085	-1.3333333730697632	10	 It was an excuse to get Sean Connery into a James Bondish role without being James Bond cause they didn't want to pay for that and he (stutter) shoots people and he acts like oh I'm Sean Connery {mumble} you gotta shoot people, this is how you do it
28006	91.384	96.255	-2.3333332538604736	13	 It's like he was really hurting for money so he picked the first script that came along
28006	86.894	91.426	-2.0	12	 I mean, come on Sean, can't do you do better than that? (stutter) It's just {sigh}
28006	99.276	101.702	-1.6666666269302368	15	 It doesn't make a lot of sense
28006	95.664	99.737	-3.0	14	 It's just a horrible, stupid movie
28006	116.766	121.009	-2.0	17	 So they go up into the mountains or something after the bad guy
28006	101.122	117.576	-1.3333333730697632	16	 The action sequences are sometimes way too long and sometimes they're too short and it just, it jumps around, it's like oh he's going to his, you know, his (uhh) his castle of fortressness, we have to go get him
28006	128.609	132.852	-2.3333332538604736	19	 It was a really dull story line, it doesn't make a lot of sense

286943	8.572	29.447	0.0	2	 Bride Wars is a movie starring (umm) Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv and Emma who are two girls who are best friends who get engaged at about the same time and (umm) they're plan to do everything together, being each other's maids of honor, et cetera et cetera
286943	45.907	53.741	-1.3333333730697632	5	 This movie (umm) if you saw previews for it it looks kind of funny, but this movie actually wasn't very funny
286943	37.785	46.388	-0.3333333432674408	4	 (umm) And a small war between them begins (umm) because they both just (umm) don't want to make any compromises

286943	52.741	59.778	-1.6666666269302368	6	 It was very (umm) average, very predictable, and the acting wasn't that great
286943	75.909	89.241	-1.3333333730697632	9	 So if you're looking for a movie to see with your girlfriends on a Friday night or a fluffy chick flick I would not recommend seeing Bride Wars because it's not what you expect, it's not worth the money, and it's not that good
286943	68.137	76.39	-1.6666666269302368	8	 And I definitely recommend that if you're considering going to see Bride Wars that you save your money because it's not that good

29751	30.153	38.925	-1.0	5	 The only reason to see this is (umm) if you are a fan of Jaime Pressly or Nicholas Brandon, (umm) those are the two stars
29751	26.481	30.734	-2.0	4	 It is (umm) {laugh} it's less than a B movie
29751	45.937	49.751	-1.3333333730697632	7	 Only reason why the, to really to see this movie

3wHE78v9zr4	45.877	49.252	0.0	5	 Here are some more details about the three legislative priorities
3wHE78v9zr4	31.57	46.179	0.3333333432674408	4	 Our three legislative priorities this year are the Transitioning to Meaningful and Integrated Employment Act or the TIME Act, the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act and the Marrakesh Treaty
3wHE78v9zr4	50.127	58.62	1.6666666269302368	7	 I'm Rose Sloan and this year we are advocating for the Transitioning to Integrated and Meaningful Employment Act or the TIME Act
3wHE78v9zr4	66.281	81.638	0.3333333432674408	9	 We want them to transition their business model to ensure that all people with disabilities, especially those being paid subminimum wages have the opportunity to transition into integrated and meaningful employment that they strive for
3wHE78v9zr4	58.838	66.892	0.6666666865348816	8	 The title of the TIME Act explains exactly what we want nonprofits who hold Section 14(c) Certificates to do
3wHE78v9zr4	90.396	103.139	0.3333333432674408	11	 But the TIME Act will give nonprofit entities three years to transition their business model and ensure that all people with disabilities are paid the fair wages we deserve
3wHE78v9zr4	81.187	90.757	-2.0	10	 Currently, over four-hundred thousand Americans with disabilities are being paid less than the minimum wage, some of them mere pennies per hour
3wHE78v9zr4	108.295	120.789	0.0	13	 The second issue this year is the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act which works to address a problem facing far too many blind and otherwise print disabled students in college
3wHE78v9zr4	103.117	108.617	1.0	12	 It's time for people with disabilities to receive fair wages
3wHE78v9zr4	128.04	138.878	1.0	15	 They offer the opportunity for blind students to use the exact same materials as their sighted peers and luckily the law actually requires that institutions of higher education provide equal access
3wHE78v9zr4	120.128	128.711	0.0	14	 The print world is inherently inaccessible to blind people and electronic instructional materials like PDFs and learning management systems and ebooks
3wHE78v9zr4	148.394	156.268	-1.3333333730697632	17	 Schools have no idea what to ask for, manufacturers aren't really embracing accessibility solutions and blind students are the ones that pay the price
3wHE78v9zr4	138.786	148.915	-1.6666666269302368	16	 The problem is that requirement has no specifics, no criteria, no guidelines telling schools this is what accessibility looks like and this is what you should demand from the market
3wHE78v9zr4	171.112	178.348	1.0	19	 Our goal is to improve access for blind students, reduce litigation and stimulate an accessible digital marketplace
3wHE78v9zr4	156.715	171.514	1.3333333730697632	18	 The TEACH Act authorizes the creation of voluntary accessibility guidelines so this is what accessibility looks like, this is what you should demand from the market and then incentivizes schools to only use technology that conforms to those guidelines with a safe harbor from litigation

P0UHzR4CmYg	185.679	195.08	1.3333333730697632	22	 So sometimes however, the tools we use to automate some of our content distribution and sharing processes can exacerbate a mistake

P0UHzR4CmYg	-0.029	19.05	1.3333333730697632	0	- One of the top questions I consistently get asked is: how do I scale my engagement across social? See, managing large communities or listening all the time, it's time consuming, and we've developed so many time-saving apps and software to help us automate the process, but herein lies the distinction
P0UHzR4CmYg	33.535	38.895	0.6666666865348816	3	 It's the blending of the two that's an art form, and it's always evolving
P0UHzR4CmYg	26.451	33.986	0.6666666865348816	2	 The bottom line is that meaningful one-on-one conversations require human-to-human interaction and a personal touch

P0UHzR4CmYg	58.858	69.186	0.0	7	 I approach it this way for myself, and a word of caution, while great tools do help us automate the process, too much automation of engagement gets us in trouble
P0UHzR4CmYg	55.755	59.359	1.0	6	 This will make the difference for companies and for people
P0UHzR4CmYg	74.692	81.967	1.0	9	 See, unfortunately the science of automation has taught your target audience to distrust most marketing

P0UHzR4CmYg	81.516	112.408	0.3333333432674408	10	 For instance, when you're doing e-mail triage every morning, do you question whether a particular e-mail is from a real person or is it an e-mail blast that's been personalized to you? Are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re-targeted? Or do you stop looking at your direct messages on Twitter because all you seem to receive are automated messages? Your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are, and in this discussion of automation, let's also consider the human error factor
P0UHzR4CmYg	125.067	136.084	0.6666666865348816	13	 But digital sharing, especially immediacy of social, has made many of us wish there were more filters in place to prevent human mistakes from coming in

R9xTBw3MCWI	119.051	138.359	1.0	12	 So 2:08review for most of you especially if you've taken the health three-unit health class which isn't required to transfer to a UC and even to transfer to a CSU you have a lot of options in that Area E but if you've taken it again this chapter will be just a good reminder
R9xTBw3MCWI	153.602	168.69	0.3333333432674408	15	 So think about it this week and think about getting back on track and making sure as you get busier and busier and as finals approach that you do not dream of neglecting to take care of your most magnificent possession
R9xTBw3MCWI	145.531	154.173	0.3333333432674408	14	 Remember was it sleep that you needed more? Or healthy vegetables? Or what is it that you need to keep your health your mind and your body healthy
R9xTBw3MCWI	173.727	177.181	1.6666666269302368	17	 I got 86 so I'm pretty happy with that
R9xTBw3MCWI	168.279	174.447	0.6666666865348816	16	 This week you also get a chance to take a little test to see how long you're going to live
R9xTBw3MCWI	179.104	185.472	0.3333333432674408	19	 Let's see how many if you can beat me and a think that's it for my intro
R9xTBw3MCWI	176.241	180.104	0.0	18	 My current habits will get me to the grand old age of 86
R9xTBw3MCWI	6.098	21.734	0.3333333432674408	1	 I want you to imagine you are really really rich and you can have anything you want to have I want you think about might be a particular car, it might be a race horse it might be a house on the beach
R9xTBw3MCWI	-0.488	7.098	1.0	0	Let's use some of the creativity we talked about last week for this chapter
R9xTBw3MCWI	24.097	29.447	1.0	3	 I want you imagine maybe even close your eyes and imagine that you have that possession
R9xTBw3MCWI	20.824	24.847	0.6666666865348816	2	 Think about a possession that you would like to actually own
R9xTBw3MCWI	55.475	63.14	0.3333333432674408	5	 Maybe and those of you have children I want you to think about how hard you strive to be the best parent you can be
R9xTBw3MCWI	28.527	55.168	0.3333333432674408	4	 How would you feel and how it would be to have that item in your life and now I want you to imagine how you would take care of that object If it was a car, for example, I know a lot of you have dream cars how would you take care of ti? Would you read the instruction manual? Would you make sure it had tune ups? Would you polish it to perfection and make sure it was always in its prime state
R9xTBw3MCWI	76.308	80.082	1.0	7	 We know that good health is more important than anything
R9xTBw3MCWI	62.14	77.268	0.0	6	 You try to buy healthy food and take care of that child or what about a pet? What did your pet have for breakfast this morning? This chapter is all about health and as you can see what I'm trying to get to here
R9xTBw3MCWI	84.799	105.943	-0.6666666865348816	9	 People who are sick or who don't have good health would give all away to have good health and yet how well do we take care of ourselves? Do we read our instrucion manual? Well we don't come with one but do we read articles about health and how to eat well and take care of our bodies? Do we eat well do we sleep do we do all those things we know we're supposed to do
R9xTBw3MCWI	79.082	84.811	1.0	8	 It's more important than that race car or that race horse or that magnificent house
RB3HA-ZMtFw	5.21	31.642	0.3333333432674408	1	Getting out from liberalism does not mean to get out from the political vision of Benedetto Croce, which liberal political vision, in those days, was the philosophical legitimacy of the political world of the bourgeois civilization, the world of Goethe and Mozart, the world of the great bourgeois culture.
RChkXDS8ulE	2.985	23.8	-1.0	1	Um when an applicant asks how much do I have to do, um, that shouldn’t sound very good to them um because anytime you’re um presenting yourself or entering a professional school you uh really should be an individual that kinda goes above and beyond the call of what you have to do or what the basics are.
RChkXDS8ulE	28.876	47.705	1.0	3	Um and so I know there are some programs that may require a basic number of shadowing or volunteer hours um but I really think you should do it because you’re interested in it um and you, you, you want to enhance yourself uh in order to make yourself potentially a better doctor down the road in our case.
RChkXDS8ulE	58.868	67.41	1.0	5	Uh so please do volunteer work because you’re interested and you want to make a difference in other people’s lives and you’ll get a whole lot more out of it by following that.
RChkXDS8ulE	47.114	59.369	0.3333333432674408	4	Uh and so, you know, anytime I hear uh “how much do I have to do” with regard to volunteering, um, it’s probably not gonna be uh, uh good quality indicator if you’ve been doing it because you had to do it.
ROC2YI3tDsk	84.868	105.035	0.6666666865348816	11	From pushing trollies in Tesco when I was 15, I’ve worked for Tesco’s, for Sainsbury’s, I went to Sainsbury’s as a trainee buyer in London about 12-13 years ago then went to work for Waitrose as a buyer, then took the opportunity to come back up to Scotland (because there aren’t many buying jobs in Scotland) three years ago.
ROC2YI3tDsk	80.778	85.609	0.6666666865348816	10	I got to this position really by working in the retail industry for a long time.
ROC2YI3tDsk	111.907	127.963	0.3333333432674408	13	So get a summer job at a local producer or farm, go to college and get your qualifications, be it relevant to the marketing side or retail, there are all sorts of degrees appropriate to the industry, and again work in a supermarket.
ROC2YI3tDsk	104.464	112.907	0.3333333432674408	12	The advice I’d give to anyone interested in a career in the food industry is to get involved with the suppliers at an early age – know your products.
ROC2YI3tDsk	127.212	136.733	1.6666666269302368	14	It’s one of those things which funds you through university, but it gives you that real learning about products and speaking to customers and helps you understand the whole industry.

ROC2YI3tDsk	16.394	24.937	1.0	3	The best part of the job, I would say, would be when you’re giving a big new contract or a new listing to, in particular, a small supplier because that’s where it means jobs.
ROC2YI3tDsk	9.22	17.215	1.6666666269302368	2	It’s looking for quality products that we can sell or our customers demand, it’s looking for different and exciting ideas within the marketplace.
ROC2YI3tDsk	31.36	40.053	0.6666666865348816	5	Your decisions in your everyday job, from seeing the quality products to listing them on your shelves, that affects jobs and communities, it goes all the way down the chain.
ROC2YI3tDsk	24.186	32.091	1.0	4	You could list a product in 20 or 30 stores, it could mean an extra five or six jobs at that particular supplier, so that’s always a good good moment.
ROC2YI3tDsk	39.053	48.184	0.0	6	Sometimes you can underestimate the importance you can have to different suppliers and actually to employment, so it’s absolutely fundamental, it helps the whole Scottish food industry.
ROC2YI3tDsk	65.912	81.429	0.6666666865348816	9	I think you need to have a good eye for a product, you need to be very patient, you need to be good at communicating because we have to communicate within our retail side and our head office, government bodies, all sorts of suppliers and other people, so being a key communicator is absolutely essential.
ROC2YI3tDsk	54.158	66.912	2.3333332538604736	8	There are great fun parts to the job about seeing great products, great suppliers, but actually there’s a lot of time needs to be spent doing the number crunching analysis, it’s a boring part but it needs to be done, it’s all part of the job.

RsE2gYghZ2s	28.946	37.878	0.3333333432674408	2	Or, if you're good enough, you can make percussion ambient where it's background noise but it's still percussive and still beat, and it keeps time, but it's still there.

SYQ_zv8dWng	5.589	12.795	0.6666666865348816	1	 What's Equity? Equity in your home is when you, well, it's what you own in your home
SYQ_zv8dWng	0.0	6.05	0.3333333432674408	0	- Hi, it's Tim Allwood from Compass Property, here today to talk to you about Equity
SYQ_zv8dWng	23.727	30.963	-0.6666666865348816	3	 The big problem is, a lot of people leave their equity sitting at home all day doing nothing, so to speak, in the cupboard
SYQ_zv8dWng	11.884	24.239	0.6666666865348816	2	 So if you take off what your home's worth, $500,000, say, if you owe $200,000, that's equity of $300,000, okay? So it's the difference between what you owe and what your house is worth, your equity
SYQ_zv8dWng	34.573	43.555	0.6666666865348816	5	 So what we propose you do is what most clever Australians do, is grab some of that equity, keep it secure, don't take all of it, just a good amount of it
SYQ_zv8dWng	30.362	35.503	0.3333333432674408	4	 While you go and work your butt off, and your equity's sitting there doing nothing
SYQ_zv8dWng	47.244	55.787	0.0	7	 So what you need to be clear about is you don't have to spent all your equity, and we can actually take enough equity to make sure there's a nice buffer
SYQ_zv8dWng	42.595	47.496	0.6666666865348816	6	 So we use that to purchase the income-producing asset, an investment property
SYQ_zv8dWng	59.696	70.404	0.0	9	 And I'll also talk in my next video about whether you should be looking at cash flow neutral, cash flow positive, cash flow negative, and in fact, what that really does mean
SYQ_zv8dWng	54.787	60.167	0.0	8	 So you don't, it's actually no money down for your investment property, we'll talk about that in another video

WoL4fCxGd8Q	160.137	165.927	-0.3333333432674408	17	I give this song a 2/5. I'd like to know what you guys think leave your comments in the section below.

WoL4fCxGd8Q	14.159	20.307	0.0	2	Now this is the second collaboration that we know of that Kanye West has done with Paul McCartney.
WoL4fCxGd8Q	50.846	63.0	0.0	5	If you have a question about anything you just Google it and you can find so much information at your finger tips, but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song.
WoL4fCxGd8Q	73.215	80.83	-2.3333332538604736	7	I wasn't a fan of Only One I thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song I didn't have much expectation going in.
WoL4fCxGd8Q	79.83	87.944	1.0	8	I am a fan of Paul McCartney and Rihanna , but i am not a big Kanye fan, but i do recognize that he is a pretty talented guy.
Wu-wQTmxRgo	31.709	40.961	0.6666666865348816	2	I don't need that appeal like you guys allow you guys come here for the cinematic stuff for the positivity Which is what I love to spread the relationship stuff

X2Hs89fZ2-c	81.815	87.365	0.0	13	 And pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	190.149	194.372	0.0	27	 And in this class we really only use shapefiles or feature classes.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	140.781	149.903	0.3333333432674408	20	 All of these things can be stored within the shapefile data as an attribute table-- can be displayed.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	148.903	163.442	1.0	21	 This is what makes GIS software so powerful It is also-- In this section we also talk about knowing how good quality your data are.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	162.482	178.558	1.0	22	 So making sure we know where to find metadata, what types of metadata makes your data better or how do we understand who produced the data what the projection was.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	104.793	115.391	0.0	16	 Make sure you understand the difference between layers and features, and shapefiles and feature classes classes, and feature classes and feature datasets.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	128.24	141.781	1.3333333730697632	19	ArcMap allows us to display these not nonspatial features, for example population of the state, population change...  what else can we display... disease  rates.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	224.84	233.912	0.0	32	 So pay attention to the files that are associated with it and how to move data from place to place, regardless of the data format we're looking at.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	220.361	225.351	0.3333333432674408	31	  You will see you have several files associated with each data set.

X2Hs89fZ2-c	193.372	206.933	0.0	28	 So make sure that you understand what separates shapefiles and feature classes-- feature classes are stored in geodatabases, shapefiles are not.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	3.952	11.138	0.3333333432674408	1	 We start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the ArcGIS software.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	0.0	4.054	0.3333333432674408	0	In this module, we're are focusing specifically on spatial data.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	14.259	22.333	0.0	3	 So you should remember that ArcMap is the component--the main component of ArcGIS.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	10.448	15.259	0.0	2	 Now in Module 1 you were exposed to ArcMap and ArcCatalog.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	31.52	45.49	0.0	5	The second component is ArcCatalog is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different datasets, change projection, added thumbnails, everything like that.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	21.333	31.183	1.0	4	 This is where you create your data, edit data, view data, analyze your map, create maps, it is the workhorse of the ArcGIS program.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	51.025	55.697	0.6666666865348816	7	Where we get into looking at very specific geoprocessing tools.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	45.079	52.025	0.0	6	 And then the last part, ArcToolbox, the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	60.324	68.079	0.3333333432674408	9	 Make sure you pay attention to the difference between our two key types of spatial data models vector and raster data.
X2Hs89fZ2-c	87.522	95.038	0.3333333432674408	14	The last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to ArcGIS and GIS in general.
X6N7UEFJLNY	0.0	8.903	0.3333333432674408	0	Now that we've talked about whether your choosing battery powered or hardwired, you've got to determine how and when you're going to use this.
X6N7UEFJLNY	16.584	21.774	0.3333333432674408	3	You can set it so that it's motion activated  -- The minute you move your car, the GPS turns on.
X6N7UEFJLNY	11.136	17.105	0.0	2	You can set your GPS to turn on a Monday through a Friday and not work on the weekends.
X6N7UEFJLNY	24.366	34.366	1.0	5	The beauty of it is no matter what you decide, you can log on to any computer as long as you have internet access, and you can see where your vehicle has been and what it's doing at any given time.
X6N7UEFJLNY	21.393	25.047	0.6666666865348816	4	You can also set it so that it's on every minute of every day.

XKyumlBmix8	41.697	43.654	0.6666666865348816	9	Let's put it on pause for a second okay
XKyumlBmix8	40.819	42.697	0.6666666865348816	8	Okay good now stop right there
XLjpZUsFEXo	94.117	97.602	0.6666666865348816	11	Well that's important, you don't want to be doing it in a dark room.
XLjpZUsFEXo	81.227	94.898	1.3333333730697632	10	And then the other thing you want to need is a little bit of a light of course we're shooting this here for Expert Village, we're lit and you can see me very clearly that's why on your video that you're watching me on right now looks great, the quality looks real good.
XLjpZUsFEXo	96.901	111.061	1.0	12	Even if it means getting a little desk lamp and aiming at you or aiming it at the ceiling and bouncing the light at you, whatever you can do to get a little bit of light in front of you will make your quality of your video that much better.
XLjpZUsFEXo	40.02	53.263	0.3333333432674408	5	Now some computers nowadays even have them built in, of course this is an older webcam that still works great for what I'm doing but the newer webcams have better quality and they have microphones built right in.

gLTxaEcx41E	54.468	73.716	0.0	4	 The reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing, or can I say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways, is just pure mystery
gLTxaEcx41E	104.075	129.479	0.0	7	 What is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero? And how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in [INAUDIBLE]? That's what this is all about and that's what, certainly, Sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with Theseus
gLTxaEcx41E	81.426	104.476	0.3333333432674408	6	 And that's why I want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of Athens, which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city, but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero
gLTxaEcx41E	145.271	161.776	0.6666666865348816	9	 But here, in Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles, who's in his 90s, really identifies with this wretched old man and how he's struggling with the difficulties of old age and the prospect of dying
gLTxaEcx41E	129.946	145.812	0.3333333432674408	8	 And the flip side is that's also why he's so fascinated with Oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that character's life
gR3igiwaeyc	46.406	53.921	-0.3333333432674408	10	Working together allowed us to transcend our natural constraints, Marx argued, but the way labor is organized leads to massive inequalities

gR3igiwaeyc	-0.488	5.88	-0.3333333432674408	0	But what Marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints, we entangled ourselves in new social constraints

gcFECfN4BCU	157.434	165.966	1.0	20	 You might make it more official, but you actually don't create a personal brand that doesn't already exist within you
gcFECfN4BCU	165.226	169.568	0.3333333432674408	21	 So that is my message for today
gcFECfN4BCU	168.568	173.37	2.0	22	 If you would like to leave your biggest takeaway message in the comments that you would be great
gcFECfN4BCU	172.39	177.48	2.0	23	 I love to hear what you guys think and pop over to my blog torimackle
gcFECfN4BCU	10.408	13.393	0.6666666865348816	1	 So I am Tori from torimackle
gcFECfN4BCU	-0.438	11.088	1.0	0	- So what actually is personal branding? You hear people saying brand yourself and have a personal brand, but knowing actually what it is and how to do it is another story
gcFECfN4BCU	12.543	15.319	0.0	3	 That is what I am going to talk about today
gcFECfN4BCU	21.133	26.174	0.0	5	 Not your products, not the things that you recommend, but actually you
gcFECfN4BCU	14.429	21.525	0.3333333432674408	4	 So when you brand yourself, you are at the centre of your business
gcFECfN4BCU	33.116	40.362	1.6666666269302368	7	 So with a personal brand, you can build a following of people that know, like and trust you
gcFECfN4BCU	25.174	33.937	0.3333333432674408	6	 So you probably heard this before, people actually relate to people and not businesses or companies
gcFECfN4BCU	58.907	79.313	1.0	9	 With a personal brand, it doesn't matter what happens with social media or any company that you are associated with or any products that you recommend because you are at the centre of your business
gcFECfN4BCU	39.681	59.528	1.3333333730697632	8	 And when people trust you, they're now more likely to listen to your recommendations and want to know what it is that you are doing and how they can get the same thing or what it is what you are recommending because they trust that if they listen to you, they are going to get the solutions that they are after and it's the solutions that are the most important
gcFECfN4BCU	87.383	94.469	0.6666666865348816	11	 Everything else is like spokes that come off this central point which is you
gcFECfN4BCU	78.313	87.984	0.6666666865348816	10	 So it doesn't matter what happens with those things because your business is always going to be long term and sustainable if it is about you and your personal brand
gcFECfN4BCU	102.937	108.457	1.0	13	 Your personal brand really is about your values and what you stand for and showing people that
gcFECfN4BCU	93.858	102.86	1.0	12	 Now, it may or may not be a surprise to you that you actually already have a personal brand
gcFECfN4BCU	111.648	124.211	1.3333333730697632	15	 If you've got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area, as a leader in some description, then you probably already have a personal brand
gcFECfN4BCU	107.527	112.139	1.0	14	 So people can have a personal brand that actually don't have a business
gcFECfN4BCU	127.452	136.593	1.0	17	 So what do other people say about you? What do other people say that you do for a living? Those are the things that are actually represented in a personal brand
gcFECfN4BCU	123.211	128.232	0.3333333432674408	16	 So a personal brand really is what you are known for by other people
gcFECfN4BCU	152.974	158.434	0.0	19	 A personal brand isn't something that you can not have one day and have the next day
gcFECfN4BCU	135.593	153.974	0.3333333432674408	18	 Now, personal brands can actually open a whole bunch of doors for you and if you make your personal brand official and make it a business, then you can actually monetize those opportunities which is what is super exciting about a personal brand and it is really something that you build overtime

r46amqjpWgg	50.586	58.81	1.6666666269302368	7	 So limit yourself to using stories, and your speech is going to be much more effectively communicated, and you're going to feel a lot more confident giving it
r46amqjpWgg	45.488	51.307	1.3333333730697632	6	 Stories are easy to retell without needing notes because you already know them
r46amqjpWgg	61.102	66.542	1.0	9	You want to make sure that you're looking all around at the various guests in the room
r46amqjpWgg	58.758	62.102	1.3333333730697632	8	 Second point when you're delivering a speech is eye contact
r46amqjpWgg	68.975	81.109	1.3333333730697632	11	 Try varying your gaze every few seconds to different parts of the room and that will make a huge difference in peoples ability just to interact with you and feel like they're being personally spoken to during your speech
r46amqjpWgg	65.542	69.975	2.0	10	 You want to make a personal connection with each and every one of them
r46amqjpWgg	90.675	103.628	1.3333333730697632	13	 So one tip we can give you is to look at the friendly faces - focus on a few key people in the audience who are smiling, who ARE engaged, and just keep alternating between them when you're looking during your speech
r46amqjpWgg	80.788	91.635	0.0	12	 It can get a little intimidating looking into the eyes of complete strangers, especially because people tend to have their tv face on when they're watching a speech they're just deers in the headlight kind of thing
r46amqjpWgg	107.148	109.924	0.0	15	 Now you have to make sure you're watching the clock
r46amqjpWgg	103.067	107.849	1.6666666269302368	14	 Tip number 3 - you've lost your notes, you're making eye contact, that's great
r46amqjpWgg	113.254	125.089	1.3333333730697632	17	 A 45 second speech is no good because people won't think its heartfelt, but a 45 minute speech is going to have your audience in tears - and not the good kind! So make sure you're practicing your speech in advance
r46amqjpWgg	109.642	113.855	1.0	16	 Stories are fantastic but they can also be long winded and drawn out
r46amqjpWgg	130.355	133.979	1.3333333730697632	19	 A good speech length is anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes
r46amqjpWgg	124.089	131.026	0.3333333432674408	18	 Pull out your iphone, your smartphone, and time yourself ahead of the wedding so that you know exactly how long it is
r46amqjpWgg	192.025	198.922	1.3333333730697632	31	 So feel confident and enjoy this opportunity to tell the bride and the groom how much they mean to you
r46amqjpWgg	183.295	192.307	2.6666667461395264	30	 If you do that - you keep it conversational, you use stories, you make eye contact, you lose those notes, you're going to give an incredible wedding speech
r46amqjpWgg	198.241	206.634	1.0	32	 You're going to do great! If you still aren't sure how to write your wedding speech, head back to our previous video: the 5 keys to writing a great wedding toast

rcfnqiD0y8o	8.023	13.792	0.0	2	So let's unpack why this is in the first place and look at some tips for dealing with it
rcfnqiD0y8o	22.321	28.928	0.0	4	In fact, it probably started early on in the group where you tried to get a discussion going as the leader
